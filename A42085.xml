            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>THeſe Words are a juſt Expoſtulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a Prophet of the Lord with the rebellious and ſtiff-necked Sons of <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Joſeph.</hi> God had ſo fully reveal'd himſelf unto them, and ſo plainly chalk'd out the way, which they ſhould walk in, that 'twas abſolutely impoſſible they ſhould be either ignorant of the one, or miſtaken in the other, without willful Perverſeneſs and the moſt ſtudied Prevarication. He made himſelf known even by his name <hi>Jehovah</hi> to their Fathers in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and aſſur'd them, by many mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous or Supernatural Acts of Vengeance upon the Heads of their Enemies, that He, who is the Author of Nature, the Control<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler of Second Cauſes, and the Soveraign
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:52696:6"/>
Commander of all the World, vouchſaf'd, in a moſt peculiar manner, to become their God. He brought them out of that Land of their Captivity, that Houſe of their Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, with a mighty hand and ſtretched-out Arm: marching himſelf at the Head of their Armies in a Pillar of Cloud by Day, and a Pillar of Fire by Night. He afterwards moſt ſolemnly proclaim'd himſelf to them before the glorious Battalions of attending Angels upon Mount <hi>Sinai</hi>: even entring into a Covenant with his People; and, as their Lord and King, giving them Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, Laws, and Statutes, for the Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation and Government of their Publick and Private Concerns, their Lives and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. In ſhort, He made <hi>Iſrael</hi> alone, of all the Nations of the Earth, his Firſt-born; array'd him with the Excellency of Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and the Excellency of Power; caus'd all his Brethren to bow down before him, and his name to be a Bleſſing and a Praiſe in all the Earth.</p>
               <p>And yet ſo perverſe and untoward was the Diſpoſition of this People, ſo mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrouſly diſingenuous and ungrateful their Returns, that they never ſeriouſly conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered what he had done, the wonderful Mercies he daily ſhew'd to them; but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways turn'd their Backs, and fell away

like their Forefathers, ſtarting aſide like a broken Bow. Tho' the Sons of <hi>Levi</hi> throughout all their Tribes inſtructed them continually in the Law of the Lord, and Prophets were ſent in every Generation to continue them in the Knowledge and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of their God; nay, tho' God, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent their ſeeking after lying Divinations, was pleas'd, in a moſt extraordinary man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, to reſide himſelf amongſt them, and to be always ready, by his Urim and Thummim, to anſwer and direct them in all momentous Emergencies; yet, they perpetually affronted him to his very Face, and provok'd him to Jealouſie by their ſhameleſs Backſlidings. They forſook God their Saviour, and lightly eſteem'd the Rock of their Salvation: not only rejecting him from being their King when he reign'd with the tender Mercies and Indulgencies of a Father; but alſo diminiſhing him even in his Godhead, by ſetting up other Lords beſides him to Rule over them. No ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er did the Government <note n="*" place="margin">1 Kings 12.30.</note> introduce or <note n="†" place="margin">2 Kings 12.3. Ch. 18.4.</note> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerate the Superſtitions of ſtrange Worſhip, but they diſplay'd at large the Levity and Baſeneſs of their Temper; either cauſleſly falling off from the God of their Fathers, and devoting themſelves wholly to the Abominations of their Neighbours, or ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crilegiouſly

dividing between Him and Them, between the Lame and the Blind, and the Almighty God. The Temple of the Lord ſhall not be ſhut up nor broken down, if the Houſes of Idols may alſo ſtand open and be frequented; nor the Prieſts of the Living God be moleſted in their Office, provided the ſame Liberty be allow'd to the Worſhippers of <hi>Daemons.</hi> In a word, They'll be contented to Worſhip ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times before the Ark of the Lord, if at others they may as religiouſly bow them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the Houſe of <hi>Rimmon</hi>; and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voutly ſing Praiſes to the God of Heaven, may they joyn likewiſe in the Adorations and Services of <hi>Baal.</hi>

               <p>This lukewarm, indifferent, trimming Behaviour, this deſultory, faithleſs, ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Temper being juſtly reprov'd and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd by the Prophets, was ſo far from returning to a due ſtability in the ways of Godlineſs, that it ran out into the violent, outrageous Extreams of Bigotry and Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition: not contenting it ſelf any longer with the Schiſmatical Erection of Altars againſt Altars, but under the ſpecious Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours of ancient Sophiſtry, the plauſible Pretences of a more excellent way of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, proceeding even to throw down all the Altars of God in the Land, to revile,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:52696:7"/>
perſecute, and ſlaughter his Servants, and to advance and cheriſh the Authors of Schiſm, the Incendiaries of Church and State, and the Patriots of their Irreligion, the Prophets of <hi>Baal</hi> only. As tho' to ſerve God in his own way was an unreaſonable Impoſition upon the Liberty of Conſcience, and the Patriarchs and Prophets were all Idiots and Mad-men, becauſe they and their Families would ſerve the Lord.</p>
               <p>This revolting, light, unſtable People, the Prophet <hi>Elijah</hi> (I ſay) expoſtulates with in the Text; plainly affirming, that 'tis altogether inconſiſtent with the Nature of true Piety to halt between two Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or (as <hi>Grotius</hi> explains it) to alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate and vary in the Objects of their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, ſometimes Worſhipping God, and ſometimes <hi>Baal</hi>; it being their indiſpenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Duty, once for all, to ſatisfie themſelves throughly which of theſe two is God, and then for ever to renounce the one, and to fix and centre in the Service of the other. <hi>How long</hi> (ſays he) <hi>halt ye between two Opinions? If the Lord be God, follow him; But if</hi> Baal, <hi>then follow him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>How ſeaſonably we may, with this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtulation in our Mouth, addreſs our ſelves to the Preſent Age, I need not inform you. Every Man, that looks carefully about him,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:52696:8"/>
and ſeriouſly conſiders the preſent Poſture of Affairs, ſees 'tis abſolutely neceſſary. The Life and Spirit of Religion ſeem to be baniſh'd out of our Streets; and nothing but Scepticiſm and Incredulity, Superſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Profaneneſs, Hypocriſie and Diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation, to dwell in our Land. To pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote their own Ends, or the Intereſt of a Party, Men profeſs themſelves Sons of the Eſtabliſh'd Church, frequent her Aſſemblies, conform to her Injunctions, and appear zealous and devout in her holy Offices. But all this while they do but flatter her with their Mouth, and diſſemble with her in their Tongue; for their Heart is ſo far from being whole with her, that they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt her Conſtitution, repine at her Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment, and conſtantly ſtrike in with her deadly Enemies, endeavouring by all means poſſible to ſupplant and overthrow her. They talk perpetually of the Loveli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Friendſhip, and wiſh that our <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi> might at length be at Peace and Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty within her ſelf: and yet at the ſame time they think it no Sin to frequent unlawful Aſſemblies; tho' they thereby widen her Breaches, ſtrengthen the Hands of her Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, confirm their Prejudices, and become the Abetters and Promoters of an execrable Schiſm. In a word, They are exactly of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:52696:8"/>
the ſame Temper and Complexion with the upbraided People in the Text, ſtanding ready, as the Tide of their Intereſt turns, to revolt from God to his Rival, from Truth to Falſhood, from Union to Schiſm, from the Church to a Conventicle.</p>
               <p>Now this indifferent Temper they ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily ſtile Moderation; which is a Vertue truly excellent and laudable in it ſelf, but the leaſt underſtood by theſe Men of any in the Circle. That only obliges Men to manage their Diſputes, and to aſſert their Principles, of whoſe Truth they are fully perſwaded, with Temper: but This allows them to have no Principles at all, or at leaſt to act as if they had none; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently is ſo far from anſwering its Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter, that 'tis a very indecent and unreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable thing, odious and abominable in the Sight of God and Good Men, moſt impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in its Nature, and pernicious in its Conſequences. Which will evidently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear from theſe three Conſiderations:
<list>
                     <item>I. That it plainly demonſtrates, that Men are acted by no fix'd and ſteddy Principles, but are of vagrant and looſe Minds, unreſolv'd in their Judgments, unſetled in the Faith, and in truth of very little or no Religion at all.</item>
                     <item>
                        <pb n="8" facs="tcp:52696:9"/>II. That it expoſeth every particular Perſon to all the various and phanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick Spirits of Error and Deluſion. And,</item>
                     <item>III. The whole Community to Ruin and Deſtruction.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. This indifferent Temper is both im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious in its Nature, and alſo pernicious in its Conſequences, becauſe it plainly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrates that Men are acted by no fix'd and ſteddy Principles, but are of vagrant and looſe Minds, unreſolv'd in their Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, unſetled in the Faith, and in truth of very little or no Religion at all. <hi>Origen</hi> tells <hi>Celſus,</hi> that ſuch is the Nature and Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of Chriſtianity, that it utterly ſtript and deveſted Mankind of all their heredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary and moſt prevailing Immoralities: the <hi>Scythian</hi> thereby becoming mild and cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, the <hi>Perſian</hi> chaſt and continent, the <hi>Roman</hi> humble and condeſcending, and the <hi>Greek</hi> veracious and modeſt. But had the <hi>Greek,</hi> together with the Profeſſion of Chriſtianity, ſtill retain'd his Vanity and Falſneſs, the <hi>Roman</hi> his Pride and Haughti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the <hi>Perſian</hi> his Softneſs and Inconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence, and the <hi>Scythian</hi> his Fierceneſs and Inhumanity: Had (I ſay) theſe Nations, thus divided between the Chriſtian Vertues
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:52696:9"/>
and their Pagan Vices, Chriſt and their Idols, God and their Luſts, the Father had never glory'd in their Acceſſion to the Church, but moſt deſervedly excluded them from the Denomination of true Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers. For how can he ſincerely Believe God to be the Beſt of Beings, who will not Love and Serve him with his whole Heart? or Chriſt to be his only Saviour, who ſhares his Affections between Him and <hi>Belial</hi>? How can he believe Chriſtianity to be a truly divine and heavenly Inſtituti-who affects it with Lukewarmneſs, Indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferency, or Moderation? or how can he contend earneſtly for the Faith once deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd to the Saints, who ſtill fluctuates and wavers between two Opinions? The Indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferency of his Temper, abundantly betrays the Incredulity of his Heart; and having no ſettled Principles, he is in danger (like a Ship without Ballaſt) to be over-ſet with every Wind of Deluſion and Impoſture. The Second Thing to be conſidered.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This indifferent Temper is both im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious in its Nature, and alſo pernicious in its Conſequences, becauſe it expoſeth every particular Perſon to all the various and phantaſtick Spirits of Error and Deluſion. Were Men once well grounded in the Principles of their Religion, and able to
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:52696:10"/>
give a Reaſon for their profeſſion of the Faith; did they not take up their Religion upon Truſt, and (like the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans</hi>) only therefore embrace it, becauſe conſonant to the Belief and Practice of their Progenitors; they would be wonderfully delighted in the Statutes of the Lord, and walk without Offence in the Path of his Commandments. The multifarious Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances of the Enemy, and the Deceiver, would be eaſily detected and unravell'd by their Reaſon; which, aſſiſted by the uner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Records of Divine Revelation, would break through all the Fogs and Vapours of Deceit, with the Strength and Bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the faithful Witneſs in Heaven. But when the Mind lies uncultivated, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void of true Principles, and is not fram'd into a Right Underſtanding and Judgment of Divine Things; when Men cannot rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onally account for any, and therefore are indifferently inclin'd to all the ways of Worſhip, the Tempter will ſoon appear in the beautiful Form of an Angel of Light; and under that diſguiſe, unhappily decoy them into the endleſs Mazes and Laby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinths of Error. The Shadow of Religion, to their unskilful Judgments, will ſoon be effectually recommended for the Subſtance; and the External, fallacious, ſuperficial
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:52696:10"/>
Signs, be miſtaken for the Interiour and Real Acts of Devotion. A judicious, ſafe, well-grounded Piety, will be renounc'd for the wild irrational Dictates of Melancholy and Enthuſiaſm; and one phantaſtical, ſenſeleſs, unintelligible Interpreter of the Divine Oracles, be preferr'd before ten Men, that can render a Reaſon. In a word, They'll be induc'd either totally to reject the Word of God for their own pretended Inſpirations; the undefiled Law of the Moſt High, for the ſoul, impure Suggeſtions of their ungodly Spirits; or at leaſt, to mingle with the Waters of Life, the putrid Streams that flow from their own Ciſterns. This I need not prove from the Records of Antiquity: our own Nation being a ſad De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration of it at this day. For how are ſome of our Brethren, tho' they enjoy the moſt bleſſed Opportunities of a right In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, toſt to and fro (like fooliſh Children) with every Wind of ſtrange Doctrine? How are they led away by every Impoſtor from the ſimplicity of the Goſpel? and ſpoil'd and plunder'd of their Chriſtian Armour by the falſe Prophets, that are gone out into the World? Alas! were it not for the decent and orderly, the wiſe and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, the beautiful and heavenly Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Eſtabliſh'd Church, This Land,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:52696:11"/>
which was not long ſince the Glory of all Lands, would really be nothing elſe, but a Spiritual <hi>Bedlam</hi>: all the various kinds of Spiritual Phrenzy and Madneſs having en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into it, and uncomfortably filling its mournful Habitations with their outragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Blaſphemies and unintelligible Jargon. No Notion ſo abſurd and ridiculous, no Doctrine ſo monſtrous and paradoxical, no Principles ſo wicked and atheiſtical, but what find ſome dreaming Prophet amongſt us to eſpouſe and aſſert them; and that Dreamer, tho' he has neither Piety nor Learning, nothing, but the loathſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtable Verniſh of Hypocriſie and Diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation, to diſtinguiſh him from his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours; has, notwithſtanding, his Follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, Abetters; and Admirers. Mens indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferency in the Affairs of Religion unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately leads them to thoſe unlawful Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, where their unſtable and treacherous Hearts are eaſily taken captive by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Deluſion; ſo that under the pretence of trying all things, they really let go all, that is good; from Neuters, or indifferent and lukewarm Friends, commencing viru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, irreconcilable Enemies to the Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of ſound Doctrine. To ſuch Deluſions and Inpoſtures (I ſay) are Men unhappi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expoſed by their unaccountable Indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:52696:11"/>
in the Affairs of Religion. But, alas! this is not all; For,</p>
               <p n="3">3. This indifferent Temper not only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth particular Perſons to the various and phantaſtick Spirits of Error and Deluſion, but the whole Community likewiſe to Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in and Deſtruction. A Kingdom divided againſt it ſelf (ſays our <note n="*" place="margin">Mar. 3.24.</note> Lord) cannot ſtand; and by theſe means this Nation ſtands divided into ſeveral Factions and Parties, who with all imaginable Rancor and Bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs endeavour to devour and prey upon one another. Our Enemies then may ſave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the danger of venturing their Necks among us. Let them have but Patience, and we ſhall do their work for them. What their Plots and Cabals, their Fire and Fag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gots, their Gun-powder and Treaſon could never effect, our Enmities and Diviſions, our Fewds and Animoſities, our Striſes and Seditions will certainly bring to paſs. Theſe diſunite and weaken our Forces in the day of Battel. Theſe divide our Councils and evacuate the wiſe Sanctions and Decrees of our Synods. Theſe pull down our Fortreſſes, our Walls, and Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warks, and expoſe us naked and defence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs to the Incurſions of the Common Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. Tho' therefore we never ſo ſolemnly proteſt againſt the Innovations of Popery,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:52696:12"/>
and zealouſly declare our Abhorrence and Deteſtation of its impious Doctrines, unleſs we endeavour, by all lawful and warrant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able means to cement theſe Differences, we our ſelves are the Men who maintain its Intereſt here, and make way for its unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Re-admiſſion into the Land. May the Good Lord of Heaven and Earth then open all our Eyes, and cauſe us to know the Things which belong unto our Peace, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our Sins provoke him to hide them fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally from our Eyes.</p>
               <p>And thus you have ſeen, how much this indifferent Temper falls ſhort of the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter ſome Men unskilfully put upon it. That 'tis ſo far from being ally'd to that truly excellent and laudable Vertue, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, that 'tis a very indecent and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable thing; odious and abominable in the ſight of God and Good Men; moſt impious in its Nature, and pernicious in its Conſequences. That it plainly demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, that Men are acted by no fix'd and ſteddy Principles, but are of vagrant and looſe Minds, unreſolv'd in their Judgments, unſetled in the Faith, and in truth of very little or no Religion at all. That it not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expoſeth particular Perſons to the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and phantaſtick Spirits of Error and Deluſion, but the whole Community like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to Ruin and Deſtruction.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:52696:12"/>Let me then intreat you, my Brethren, for the Credit and Reputation of our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Chriſtianity; for the Honour of our moſt Beautiful, Prudent, and Pious Mother, the Church of <hi>England</hi>; for the Preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Safety, and Happineſs of theſe King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms; as you love your God, your Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, your Country, your own Souls; to be ſtedfaſt and immovable in the Profeſſion of the Faith, not walking deceitfully and in Maſquerade, as (you ſee) the manner of ſome is, nor baſely proſtituting your Conſciences by an hypocritical, prevarica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Behaviour to your Secular Intereſt; but, in ſpight of all the Terrors and Allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the World, ſerving God with a faithful and true heart, with Uprightneſs and Sincerity, all the days of your Life. And to this End, give me leave to adviſe theſe few things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That you call no Man Maſter upon Earth; <hi>i. e.</hi> That you never have any Man's Learning or Piety in ſuch Venerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as to receive all he ſays for an Oracle, for an infallible Rule of your Faith and Manners; but that you always remember, that you have a great Maſter in Heaven, who has given you a ſure and certain Rule to walk by, and who expects your Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence without any Reſerve. This Caution
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:52696:13"/>
was given by our Lord himſelf to his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples;<note place="margin">Mat. 23.</note> and it truly favours of the excellent Wiſdom and Providence of its Author. For the Proſelites of the <hi>Phariſees</hi> were poſſeſt with ſuch a Perſwaſion of the great Sanctity and unparallell'd Learning of their Maſters, that they entirely reſign'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves up to their Conduct and Guidance, becoming thereby, both in Notion and Practice, twofold more the Children of Hell than themſelves; and thoſe famous Conteſts between the <hi>Thomiſts</hi> and <hi>Scotiſts</hi> and other Diſputants in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> are wholly to be aſcrib'd to the over-weening Opinion which they all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinaciouſly retain for their own Patriarchs. Nay, the Firſt Sin that crept into the World, came this way: for I conceive, with a great and learned <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Joſeph Mede.</hi> Book 1.

                  </note> 'Tis the ſuperſtitious Reverence and unaccountable Honour, which the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:52696:13"/>
Schoolmen pay to Authority, that betrays them into many unhappy Errors, as well in their Theological as Philoſophical Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations. Honour Men then only as Men. Whatever their Natural or Acquir'd Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies may be, they are all ſubject to Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror. Try all their Doctrines therefore, whether they be of God; and believe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, tho' enforced with the greateſt Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Authority, unleſs upon due Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion you find it conſonant to Scripture and Reaſon. And ſo I come to the</p>
               <p n="2">2. Thing adviſable; which is, That you would try all Things, and not take up your Religion upon Truſt, upon the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and Recommendation of your Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, Civil, or Spiritual Fathers; but, that you would let it be (what it ought to be) a Rational Service the Reſult of your own mature impartial, and well-weigh'd Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations. And what in this I ſay unto you, I would ſay more particularly to our Diſſenting Brethren. They are equally guilty with the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> in this Point; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending too ſecurely upon the Authority, and acquieſcing in the Reports and Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentations of their Leaders. I would there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (I ſay) moſt earneſtly intreat them, as they will anſwer it at the Dreadful Day of Judgment, when every Man muſt ſtand
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:52696:14"/>
or fall by his own Conſcience, to judge for themſelves; and fairly and ingenuouſly, ſeverely and impartially, to weigh and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the Doctrine and Diſcipline, the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and Order, of our Eſtabliſh'd Church. Could we thus far prevail; I am verily par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded that thoſe Heats and Paſſions which now ſo tumultuouſly boil in ſome Mens Bowels againſt her, would all evaporate and expire; and we ſhould ſoon walk together into the Houſe of God as Friends. Which I therefore believe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe 'tis well known, that many of her Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries have been perfectly reconcil'd to her upon leſſer Motives: only by venturing to conſult their own Senſes, and calmly and ſedately to look into her Devotions. The Church did then to their unbiaſs'd Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments moſt clearly unfold her raviſhing Beauty and Brightneſs, and their wondring Eyes ſaw and confeſs'd her Parts and comely Proportions. She appear'd fair as <hi>Tirzah,</hi> comely as <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and (quite contrary to their Expectations) terrible to <hi>Enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſm</hi> and <hi>Popery</hi> too, as an Army with Banners. I would therefore (I ſay again) moſt earneſtly intreat theſe Perſons to lay aſide their Prejudices, and with their own Eyes ſeriouſly to look into and examine her Conſtitution. If ſhe injoyns any thing,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:52696:14"/>
that's inconſiſtent with any Law of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, any Law or Rule of the Goſpel, any Article of our Faith, any part of Chriſtian Worſhip, or the Practice of the Univerſal Church in the Firſt and Pureſt Ages; Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon would that we ſhould bear with their Separation. But if her Doctrine be truly conſonant to the Word of God: If her Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline ſerves directly to the Beating down the Strong-holds of Sin, and to the Promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Piety and a Good Life: If her De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions are ſubſtantially pious and prudent, ſerious and comprehensive, ſignificant and intelligible, and Every way moſt wiſely and divinely compos'd: If her Ceremonies are not only few in Number, but likewiſe decent, grave, ſignificant, and edifying in their Nature and Uſe: In a word, If ſhe does all things (according to the Apoſtolical In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction) Decently, and in order, after the Primitive Patterns, according to the beſt meaſures of Human Wiſdom. If (I ſay) ſhe does all this, (and all this 'twill be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtratively evident to every impartial Enquirer, that ſhe does) then I cannot but affirm, that their Separation from us, in point of Conſcience, is altogether unwarran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, impious, ſchiſmatical. But becauſe they are taught to be deaf to our Apologies and with an unmanly, blind, implicit Faith,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:52696:15"/>
to believe us Apoſtates to Popery and Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. I would (I ſay) moſt earneſtly beſeech them to uſe their own Senſes; and to read, to think, and to judge at laſt for themſelves. That they would not paſs Sentence upon us, before they know us; nor judge of the Doctrine or Diſcipline of our Church by the Prejudices of their Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, or the diſingenuous, illaudable Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports of their Partial Leaders; but wholly and entirely by the word of God, the ſure, infallible Rule of the Holy-Scriptures. A Method, which in the next place I likewiſe moſt heartily adviſe you to.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Then, Read the Scriptures. This is the Duty of Every Chriſtian, requir'd and injoyn'd by the Saviour of our Souls, the Lord Chriſt Jeſus. <hi>Search the Scriptures,</hi> (ſays <note n="*" place="margin">Joh. 5.39.</note> he) <hi>for in them ye have Eternal Life, and they are they which teſtifie of me.</hi> And indeed, 'twas by theſe that our Lord himſelf repell'd the impudent Aſſaults and crafty Inſinuations of the Devil: that his Apoſtles both planted and water'd his Church: and that the pious Fathers and Councils baffled the Hereſies, and put to Silence the Ignorance of fooliſh Men. Let as many of us therefore, as can diſtinguiſh between Good and Evil; Young Men and Maidens Old Men and even Children, be
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:52696:15"/>
converſant in theſe Writings. They are that Rule, which, if duly attended to, will not ſuffer us to err, being not (like the Oracles of <hi>Daemons</hi>) wrapt up in intricate, obſcure, ambiguous Expreſſions, but plain and eaſie to the meaneſt Underſtanding. Plain and Eaſie (I ſay) in all things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to Salvation; the <hi>Credenda</hi> as well as the <hi>Agenda</hi> of our Religion; the things which demand our Faith, as well as thoſe, that call for our Practice, in many places diſplaying themſelves in ſuch Capital Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, that he who runs may read them.</p>
               <p>There are indeed in theſe Writings <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, ſome obſcure Places, and hard to be underſtood. But theſe (I conceive) are not neceſſary to be underſtood; For if they were, our Heavenly Father had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly ſo deliver'd them, that by his Bleſſing upon our honeſt Labour and Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, we ſhould at length certainly, clearly, and diſtinctly underſtand them. But ſince (as I humbly conceive) they are not ſo deliver'd, but after all our Pains and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry lie ſecurely envelop'd with their own Darkneſs, we may ſafely conclude from the Goodneſs of our Maker, that they are not neceſſary to be underſtood.

               <p>But if we advance from the Ancient to the more Modern Philoſophers, we ſhall find, that, like the Sun, the higher this Doctrine of Evil Spirits aſcended, the fairer and clearer it gradually ſhew'd it ſelf; and that breaking in ſome meaſure through thoſe thick Miſts of Error, which had grievouſly over-run it ſince its firſt Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, it at length diffus'd again a true and genuine Light over the Minds of Men, notwithſtanding thoſe little Spots, which ſtill appear'd in its Face. <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Plutarch</hi> indeed, ſeems not over-willing to embrace it; yet he doubts he can give no good Account of thoſe Phantaſms or Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritions which haunted the Excellent and Philoſophical <hi>Dion</hi> and <hi>Brutus,</hi> unleſs he receives,<gap reason="foreign">

upon this account, the Apoſtle, in my Text, warns the Chriſtians to watch, and to be always upon their Guard againſt ſo potent and vigilant an Adverſary.

Now therefore, we muſt indeed acknowledge with the <note n="†" place="margin">Rev. 12.9, 10,</note> Inhabitants of Heaven, that Salvation and Strength, and the Kingdom of our God, and the Power of his Chriſt, is come unto us; for the great Dragon is caſt out, that old Serpent, call'd the Devil, and Satan, which deceiv'd the whole World: He is caſt out of his Strong-holds, and his Angels can no longer exerciſe their Tyranny in the Earth: But yet he ſtill ſitteth lurking in the thieviſh Corners of the World, and privily in his lurking Dens does he plot againſt the Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent; his Eyes are wholly ſet againſt the Saints.

<pb n="44" facs="tcp:52696:27"/>
he is bound to his Good-behaviour; yet, as an Explorator or Searcher for faults, he goes up and down to and fro in the Earth.</p>
               <p>I know there are ſome, who will be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to object, That this Relaxation of Evil-Spirits from their dark houſes of Sorrow, can by no means conſiſt with the Wiſdom of God; For ſince his Juſtice condemn'd them to unſpeakable and Eternal Torments, 'tis next to Madneſs (ſay they) to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that he would ſuffer their Pains to receive any Diminution; which yet the Hurt which according to this Poſition they are ſometimes permitted to do to Mankind, would certainly afford them.</p>
               <p>But this ſeeming Contradiction will be eaſily reconcil'd, if we conſider, that the like Argument may be urg'd as well againſt the Abſence of good Angels from the Court of Heaven. For ſince 'tis piouſly believ'd on all hands, that the Bleſs'd Inhabitants of thoſe ſerene and peaceful Manſions are now (the time of Probation being gone long ago) fully and unalterably confirm'd in Happineſs and Glory; how can we ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, that their heavenly Father would be ſo unkind, as to deprive them of the Beati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick Intuition of his interiour Beauties, and, as it were, to baniſh his beloved Sons for a time from the Regions of Bliſs?

we need not be beholden neither to the <hi>Egyptians</hi> nor to the <hi>Platoniſts</hi> for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of this Truth; the Sacred Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory, more than once, aſſuring us, if they do not conſtantly adhere to, and inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably accompany Good Men, yet that they often deſcended to ſuccour them in their Dangers, and are alſo ſtill <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>Wherefore, in Anſwer to this Objection, we may conſider, That Kindneſs and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion are ſo twiſted and interwoven (as I may ſo ſay) with the very Eſſences of theſe glorious Creatures, that 'tis Heaven to them to relieve and aſſiſt their Fellow-Servants here below; which being joyn'd to that infinite Delight and Satisfaction, which they undoubtedly receive in the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of the Divine Will, makes abundant Recompence for the ſeeming Loſs of that more plentiful Harveſt of Joys which the Bleſſed reap in the Manſions above.</p>
               <p>And on the other ſide: The Evagation of Evil Spirits from their infernal Dungeon, muſt rather afford them freſh Occaſions of Torture, than adminiſter any true Solace or real Content. For ſo fierce and implacable, ſo inſolent and outrageous, ſo envious and

But not to proſecute theſe Conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons any farther: The bare diſmal Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions of that accumulated Puniſhment, which after the Laſt Day they muſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly undergo for all the Evil they have done amongſt Men, are ſufficient to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoiſe whatever accidentary Satisfaction

               <p>I foreſee but one Scruple more, that may ariſe againſt this Diſcourſe; which is, That ſuppoſing Men were very well diſpos'd to believe all we have ſaid, yet thoſe An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick, ridiculous Circumſtances, which in the Narrations even of the graveſt Perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nages do accompany many things of this nature, ſtrongly argue the Uncertainty of them all.</p>

Thus, as though it had been a ſmall thing to have caus'd infinite Numbers of the Heavenly Hoſt to let fall their Crowns, and to have ſwept away with his Tail the third part of the Stars of Heaven, we find him in the way Infancy of the World, nay (if ſome ſay true) in the ſame Day where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Man was Created, plotting and nontri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to ruin all Mankind in their Head. And tho' 'tis believ'd, for very good Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, that he could not, with all his Art and Subtilty, entice ſo much as the Impure and Debauch'd Poſterity of <hi>Cain</hi> to Idolatry before the Flood; yet we are too well aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſur'd, that he laid the Foundations of his Empire very early in the World. For Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorians ſay, that even in the time of <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> who was the fifth from <hi>Noah,</hi> Idolatry began mightily to prevail; theſe Helliſh Impoſtors giving Anſwers through the Images, which Men generally carv'd to themſelves in Memory of their Anceſtors, and to which, upon all Occaſions, they addreſs'd themſelves with the moſt ſolemn Veneration. And from thence, how im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perious and domineering, how haughty, arrogant, and cruel, how tyrannical and intolerable, he ſhew'd himſelf to his Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippers, till Chriſtianity appear'd in the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:52696:30"/>
World, all Hiſtories, both Sacred and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane, do abundantly teſtifie. Having ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted himſelf above all that is called God, and (the <hi>Jews</hi> excepted) rendred the whole Creation ſubject to Vanity, he ſat himſelf Lordly in the Houſe of God, acting there like himſelf, the grand Chief of the Damn'd. He ſent Miſeries and Calamities upon the Theatre of the World for his Sport and Paſtime, and ſet on one part of the Creation to bait another for his Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. Like the immane <hi>Roman</hi> Emperours, he took Pleaſure to exerciſe Men with Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and to ſee them play bloody Prizes before him. Neither thouſands of Rams, nor ten thouſands of Rivers of Oyl, could ſatisfie the raging Thirſt or Boulimy of this ravenous Wolf. He muſt needs tear in pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces the more excellent Prey, and take his Paſtime in Rivers of Human Blood. Thus in <hi>Crete</hi> and <hi>Africk</hi> under the Name of <hi>Saturn</hi> he glutted his Ears with the laſt Groans and diſmal Accents, and his devou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Jaws with the tender Carcaſſes of ſlaughter'd Infants. Thus in <hi>Cyprus, Tene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dos,</hi> and <hi>Lacedaemonia</hi>; in <hi>Carthage, France,</hi> and <hi>Germany</hi>; in <hi>Arabia, Scythia, Egypt,</hi> and <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf, he made himſelf drunk with the Blood of Men; which is atte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted not only by thoſe Chriſtian Writers

Which brings me to the other part of this my Third Particular, which is, to obſerve, what various Ways and Methods this cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Serpent takes to intrap us.</p>
               <p>When the Devil intends a Battery, he views the Strength and Situation of the Place; and where he eſpies the weakeſt Guards, there he moſt vigorouſly makes his Onſet. True it is, that in our Saviour he could have no ſuch Advantage; but how Fatal it has prov'd to his Spouſe, the Church, no Man, that
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:52696:33"/>
juſtly glories in the Title of a Chriſtian, can be ignorant. He ſtirr'd up Kings and Princes, and the greateſt Powers and Policies of the World, to confederate and combine together to extirpate and baniſh it from off the Face of the Earth. By Arms and Armies, by Strength and Subtilty, by Malice and Cruelty, he endeavour'd to ſtifle and ſmother it in its Infancy and firſt Delivery into the World. But when he found, that, notwithſtanding all this Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, it ſtill lifted up its Head in tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph, and outbrav'd the fierceſt Storms of the moſt violent Perſecutions; that neither Swords, nor Axes, nor Croſſes, nor wild Beaſts, nor Chains, nor Fire, nor all other Inſtruments of the moſt exquiſite Tortures could prevail any thing at all; but that, as he complainingly tells <hi>Porphyry,</hi> they might as well, and to better purpoſe, attempt to write upon the Surface of the Water, or to fly like a Bird in the Air, than to reduce the Chriſtian from his Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents, and compel him to blaſpheme, he immediately betakes himſelf to other Counſels, and ſeeks to undermine that Faith, which he ſaw he could not carry by open Aſſault and Battery. And how ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsfully he thus work'd in God's Vineyard, the many Hereſies, which grew up to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:52696:33"/>
with the Goſpel, do ſufficiently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate.</p>
               <p>But to paſs from Univerſals to Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, from Communities of Men to Indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duals: Let us through all the intermediate Ages retreat to the Origin of the World, and we ſhall find him even then giving a full and convictive Evidence of that Craft and Subtilty which he exercis'd more at large in Succeeding Generations. He beheld our firſt Father entertaining his Wife with the fondeſt Careſſes of too amorous a Fancy; and therefore by the Mediation of ſo dear an Object he preſents the Temptation. He knew that his Arguments were not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing of themſelves, and therefore the beauteous hands of the young Virgin-Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs are made the Orators. Thus after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards in the ears of envious <hi>Saul</hi> he Sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the glorious Panegyricks of his Rival, and ſuggeſted to his remiſs and unguarded Succeſſor the ſofter Whiſpers of the Spirit of Fornication. Before young Beginners in Religion he diſplays a frightful Scene of enſuing Difficulties; that 'tis a ſolitary, loneſome, melancholy Profeſſion, under whoſe baleful Influence nothing but Roots of Bitterneſs, can ſpring up. He inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates into their Heads, that God is a conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Fire to all alike; that he is buſied in
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:52696:34"/>
Heaven, not only to deſtroy the Wicked, and to daſh in pieces Veſſels of Diſhonour, but likewiſe to break the bruiſed Reed, and to caſt ſmoaking Flax into the Flames of Hell. He ſuggeſts to them, that Chriſt is a hard Task Maſter; who tho' he very well knows, that our Foundation is in the Clay, yet unreaſonably obligeth us to the Work of Angels, and to the Performances of the moſt Exalted and Beatify'd Spirits: That though the Law is preſcrib'd to Perſons whoſe Varieties and different Conſtitutions cannot be regular or uniform, yet he allows no Latitude of Performance, but unmerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully binds us all to juſt Atoms and Points. And thus by opening his Mouth in Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my againſt God, and by pretending to ſpeak peaceably to Men; by deterring them either with the pretended Difficulties of Religion, or by blowing up their new-kindled Zeal into Superſtition; in ſhort, by all the Arts, which either his Helliſh Malice or Policy can invent he labours to ruin the Children of Men; ſo that if the over-ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling hand of Providence had not put a Hook into the Noſtrils of this <hi>Leviathan,</hi> the Foundations of the Intellectual, as well as of the Natural World, had long ſince been out of courſe. Which brings me to my Fourth and Laſt Particular, which is,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:52696:34"/>
to ſhew, tho' he has Malice enough to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy us all, yet that he cannot do us the leaſt Miſchief, unleſs God permits him.</p>

'Tis the Opinion, I confeſs, of the Learned Part of the World, that the Strength and Natural Faculties of this Prince of Darkneſs are nothing diminiſh'd or impair'd by his Fall; but, that he ſtill glories in the ſame Power, which ſwell'd him with ſo much Pride, as to ſay in his Heart, <hi>I will aſcend into Heaven; I will exalt my Throne above the Stars of God; I will ſit upon the ſides of the North; I will aſcend above the Heights of the Clouds; I will be like the Moſt High.</hi> Yet this ought not to diſcourage the weakeſt of us; for let his Strength be what it will, and his Malice ſo great, that (as the Queen of <hi>Sheba</hi> ſaid of <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Wiſdom and Proſperity) the half of it has not been told us; yet we are ſure that he has his Bounds and Limits pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrib'd him; and that as <hi>Jamblichus</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably remarks, <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>From what has been thus diſcours'd I ſhall now briefly deduce two or three Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rollaries, and conclude.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Then, Let us conſider, what End and Deſign God has in ſuffering theſe Enemies of Mankind to be abroad in the Earth; and ſince we ſhall find, that he leads us through this great and terrible Wilderneſs, wherein are fiery Serpents and Scorpions, that he may humble us, and that he may prove us, to do us Good at our Latter End, let us never fruſtrate ſuch gracious Purpoſes, nor provoke him by our Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance in ſin to let us fall into the hands of theſe Enemies, who already diſtreſs us
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:52696:35"/>
in our very Gates. The Arrows of the Lord are every where in the Earth, and ſhall not the Inhabitants of the World learn Righteouſneſs? If we have any real Love for our ſelves, any Concern for our true and main Intereſt, let us open our Ears to Diſcipline, and preſently return from all our Iniquities. For we ſhall not ſerve God for nought; He will make an hedge about us and about our Houſe, and about all that we have, on every ſide; His Hand ſhall hold us faſt, and his Arm ſhall ſtrengthen us, ſo that the Enemy ſhall not be able to do us violence, nor theſe wicked Spirits approach to hurt us. Not to hurt us therefore I ſay, becauſe tho' he permit them to caſt us into the Furnace of Affliction, yet he does it only to refine and purifie us from our Droſs. He may uſe them as ſharp and cutting In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments, but then 'tis with this merciful Deſign of letting out our Corruption. In ſhort, However they may ſometimes ſeem to triumph over us in this World, yet certainly there will be an End, and our Expectations ſhall not be cut off. When Death ſhall draw back the Curtain, the Face of things ſhall be utterly chang'd. Then ſhall the Righteous Man ſtand in great boldneſs before the face of ſuch as afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:52696:36"/>
him, and made no account of his La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours; and they ſhall ſay within themſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves: This is he whom we had ſometime in Deriſion and a Proverb of Reproach; we Fools endeavour'd to make his Life Madneſs, and to cauſe his End to be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Honour; but how, in ſpight of all our Malice, is he numbred among the Children of God; and whilſt we are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to Everlaſting Torments, His lot is among the Saints?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Since we are beſieg'd on every ſide by ſuch potent, ſubtil, and treacherous Enemies, let us take care to be always upon our Guard; and ſince our Journey is dangerous, and our Way ſlippery, let him that thinks he ſtands ſureſt, take continual heed leſt he fall.

And tho' I cannot deny, but that as ſome Men, for a long, obſtinate uninterrupted abuſe of God's Grace, are at laſt juſtly given up to their own Hearts Luſts, and ſuffer'd with the utmoſt bent of their Souls to

               <p>Laſtly, Let us look up to Heaven, and with Hearts full of Joy and Gratitude bleſs that God to whom alone we owe the Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of all thoſe Hours and Days of Peace, in which we ſit ſecurely under our Vines, and eat the pleaſant Fruit of our Fig-trees,

Every Senſe ſhould have its Object of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light and Danger, an <hi>Hyaena</hi> to kiſs, and to periſh in its Embraces.

               <p>THAT 'tis our Intereſt, as well as Duty, to ſet our Affection on things above, not on things on the Earth, I ſhall (without any preliminary Diſcourſe) briefly evince from theſe following Reaſons.</p>

                  <item>I. Becauſe they only are proportion'd to the utmoſt Capacity of the Soul, and conſequently they only can yield her true Satisfaction; whereas all things here are vain, inſufficient, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pty, and unſatisfying.</item>

Becauſe they only refine and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tualize our Nature, widen and enlarge our Faculties, and ſo fit and prepare us for the ſpiritual and abſtracted Entertainments of an Immortal and Divine Life; whereas all things here degravate and weigh down the Soul, reach out to her that Cup of Oblivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which makes her forget her own Nature and Excellencies, and inglori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly to take up with the enjoyments of Brutes.</item>
               </list>
               <p n="1">1. 'Tis our Intereſt, as well as Duty, to ſet our Affection on things above, not on things on the Earth, becauſe they only are proportion'd to the utmoſt Capacity of the Soul, and conſequently they only can yield her true Satisfaction; whereas all things here are vain, inſufficient empty, and unſatisfying. Whoever diligently at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to the Workings of his own Mind, and ſeriouſly conſiders the Bent, Appetites, and Inclinations of his Soul, will ſoon find her to be of ſo exalted a Nature, that not all the Good of the Creation, tho' amaſs'd together and fully enjoy'd, would be able to terminate her Deſires, to employ the whole Activity of her Love, to fix her en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire weight, or to detain and give Ancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:52696:39"/>
to her boundleſs Aſpirations. The voluptuous <hi>Epicurean</hi> (whatever he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends) can never ſatisfie the Cravings of his Soul with Corporeal Pleaſure, nor the moſt Quinteſſential <hi>Stoick</hi> find an <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, a Self-ſufficiency and Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility within his Breaſt, ariſing out of the Pregnancy of his own Mind and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Our Souls have ſtrong and weighty Motions, and nothing can bear them up, but ſomething permanent and immutable. They Sink through all theſe preſent Entertainments, as a Stone does through a watery Medium, till at length it happily arrives to its own proper Center. They may indeed enjoy ſo much of this or that particular Object, as to deſire no more of it; but then their Deſires are ſtill running out after ſome other Objects; and when they have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd and enjoy'd them too, they ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main as diſſatisfy'd as before. <hi>The Eye is not ſatisfy'd with ſeeing, nor the Ear with hearing,</hi> ſays <note n="*" place="margin">Eccleſ. 1.8.</note> 
                  <hi>Solomon.</hi> Tho' they are the wideſt of all the Senſes, and can take in more abundance with leſs Satiety, and ſerve more immediately for the Supplies of the Rational Soul; yet a Man's Eye ſtrings may even crack through Vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency of Poring, and his Ears be fill'd
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:52696:39"/>
with all the Variety of the moſt exquiſite Sounds, Harmonies, and Lectures in the World; and after all, his Soul within him be as greedy to ſee and hear more as it was at firſt. Hence ariſe Diſtractions of Heart, anxious and carking Thought for to Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row; Rovings and Inquiſitions of the Soul after infinite Varieties of earthly things; ſparklings of the Luſt; Swarms of Endleſs Thoughts; thoſe Ebbings and Flowings, thoſe Tempers and Aeſtuations of that Sea of Corruption in the Heart of Man, becauſe the Soul can find no Center here to reſt upon, nothing large enough for the Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments of ſo ample and ſo endleſs a Gueſt. In ſhort, We may (I confeſs) refreſh our ſelves with the Excellencies of the Creatures, and diſcover ſuch variety of Sweetneſs and Beauty in their Natures, as will plentifully entertain us with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightſome Speculations. But for pure Reſt and Peace, for plenary Acquieſcence and Termination of Deſires, 'tis no where (as I have <note n="*" place="margin">Doctrin of a God, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid. Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cat. &amp; Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert. p. 36, 37.</note> elſewhere ſhewn at large) to be found within the whole Latitude of the Creation. Nay, This is confirm'd by the ingenuous Confeſſion of One, who was the moſt Experienc'd of all the Sons of <hi>Adam</hi> for Enquiry, the moſt wiſe for Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, the moſt wealthy for compaſſing
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:52696:40"/>
all Earthly Delights: Who, many years ſifted out the fineſt Flour, and tortur'd Nature to extract the moſt exquiſite Spirits, the pureſt Quinteſſence, which all the Varieties of earthly Delights could afford. Who yet at laſt had nothing better to ſay of them all, than that they were Vanity and Vexation of Spirit. <hi>I have ſeen</hi> (<note n="*" place="margin">Eccleſ. 1.14.</note> ſays he) <hi>all the works that are done under the Sun, and behold All is Vanity and Vexation of Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This (I ſay) is our caſe with all theſe preſent Entertainments: They ſmilingly offer themſelves to our Embraces, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfully promiſe us all the Satisfaction our Hearts can deſire. But when we have once taken them into our Arms, they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately fade and pine away in our very Embraces, and leave the Soul weeping and diſconſolate for her unexpected Diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>But now 'tis quite otherwiſe with the things that are above. No ſooner does the Soul paſs from her dark Priſon into the Manſions of Light and Glory; but in that Paradiſe of God, where happy Spirits ſit down by immortal Streams, entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves with Songs of Love and Praiſe, ſhe finds perfect Satisfaction and Termination of all her deſires. Having
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:52696:40"/>
joyn'd herſelf to God (to ſpeak Platoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally) as a Center to a Center, ſhe reſts there with full Acquieſcence and Compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency. Whatſoever is beautiful and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, whatſoever is fair, lovely, and harmoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in the Face of Nature, ſhe contemplates in the moſt eminent manner in her Belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, the Unfoldings of whoſe Beauty diſcover to her ſuch Cauſes of Joy, of Tranſports, of Extaſies and Raviſhment of Spirit, that all her Faculties overflow with Joy and Everlaſting Gladneſs. Which brings me to my Second Conſideration, which is to ſhew, that 'tis our Intereſt, as well as Duty, to ſet our Affections on things above, not on things on the Earth, becauſe They only are permanent, ſure, and certain; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as all things here are frail, ſhort, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Now tho' we were born with all the Advantages of an healthful Body and of a chearful Spirit, and bleſt with all the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of Succeſs and Fortune: yet when we have compaſs'd all our Projects, when we are happy (if poſſible) to the utmoſt of our Capacities, when all things conſpire to compleat our Felicity, the moſt pleaſant Proſpect we can take from this higheſt pitch of humane Happineſs, is the gloomy Regions of approaching Death and
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:52696:41"/>
Darkneſs. The Fatal Sword hangs perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually over our Heads, and tho' it may poſſibly hover there for ſome time, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be long, before it fall, and cut off the Thread of Life, and ſo put a final period to all our Mirth and Happineſs. 'Tis the irreverſible Decree of Heaven, that after a ſhort, muſhroom Life, we return into Duſt and Silence; and that, when we have floated up and down a few Minutes upon the troubleſome Waves of this tempeſtuous World, we diſappear, and Sink back into the grave and bottomleſs Dungeons of Oblivion. Nay perhaps, whilſt we are dancing upon theſe reſtleſs Waves, ſome violent Accident may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the Work of Nature, and ſuddenly cruſh the Bubble into its original Nothing. In ſhort, All thoſe Differences, which now ſo much diſtinguiſh the ſeveral ſorts of Men, muſt ere long expire, and the Aſhes of the Deform'd and Beautiful, of the Learn'd and Ignorant, of the Honourable and Baſe, lie intermingled together. The Crowns of Kings, and the Shackles of the Priſoners, the Robes of Princes and the Rags of Beggars, the Gallants Bravery and the Peaſants Ruſſet, the Statiſts Policy, the Courtiers Luxury, the Souldiers Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry, and the Scholars Curioſity, muſt
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:52696:41"/>
all, ere long, be laid aſide in the Melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Retirements of the Grave.<note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>. M. Anton. ad Stipſ. lib. 5. c. 8. p. 135.</note> What then is there in all this World that deſerves our Care? What worthy the Thoughts, the Love, the Embraces of an immortal Soul? Alas! were theſe Things never ſo good and ſatisfactory in themſelves, yet this ſingle Conſideration of their Shortneſs and Uncertainty, would (like a Moth fretting a Garment) cauſe all their Beauty to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume away, and conſtrain the Wiſe and thinking Few to pronounce them Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
               <p>But as the Things that are ſeen, theſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Entertainments of Senſe, are Temporal; ſo the Things that are not ſeen, thoſe Glories, Crowns, and Scepters, that expect us in the other World are Eternal. Heaven is an Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Sabbath, the Saints Everlaſting Reſt. Their Inheritance is not only Undefil'd, but incorruptible likewiſe, and ſuch, as fadeth not away. There they Labour no more, Sin no more, Sorrow no more; but, ſecure of the Everlaſting Fruition of thoſe Unutterable Glories bask themſelves in the pleaſant Rivers of overflowing Felicity. Their Crowns are ſet with the invaluable and ſparkling Diamonds of Immortality; Their Glory is immarceſſible, and ſuffers no Eclipſe; and they follow the Lamb in
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:52696:42"/>
white Robes, and ſhine like the Stars in the Firmament for Ever and Ever. O come then, thou bright and Everlaſting Day, and break in upon theſe ſad benight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Souls of ours! Put an End to this toil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, this weariſome State, and take us into the poſſeſſion of thine own Reſt and Peace; that theſe ſuperficial, fallacious Pleaſures may never beguile us more, but we ſecurely Sabbatize in the Kingdom of God, the Eternal Comprehenſions of Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtial Glory.</p>
               <p n="3">3. 'Tis our Intereſt, as well as Duty, to ſet our Affection on things above, not on things on the Earth, becauſe They only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine and ſpiritualize our Nature, widen and enlarge our Faculties, and ſo fit and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare us for the ſpiritual and abſtracted En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainments of an immortal and Divine Life; whereas all things here degravate and weigh down the Soul, reach out to her that Cup of Oblivion, which makes her forget her own Nature and Excellencies, and ingloriouſly to take up with the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments of Brutes. When the deluded Soul is once taken Captive by the ſuperfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial, falſe gloſſing Excellencies of temporary Objects, and ſuffers herſelf to be lull'd aſleep in the Lap of ſenſual Enjoyments, they immediately ſpoil her of her Strength
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:52696:42"/>
and Beauty, and betray her into the hands of her immortal Enemies. They entirely ſhave off thoſe golden Locks, which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred her at once invincible and comely, and by clipping her radiant and ſublima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Wings, confine her to the lower Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Senſe and Materiality. Nay, by the deluſive Strains of their Magical Songs they ſo effectually ſteal away and inchant her Affections, that ſhe grows utterly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mindful of her Relations above, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns herſelf wholly to their unequal Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces. Her noble Aſpirations, which could eaſily aſcend above the utmoſt Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of corruptible Nature into the bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Habitations of immortal Bleſſedneſs, like heavy terrene Exhalations, ariſe now no higher than the Regions of Senſe; and all the rational and delicious Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of abſtracted Contemplations give way to the vile, impure ſuggeſtions of an earthly, ſenſual, and brutiſh Imagination. In ſhort, They ſo vaſtly decline her from her true and natural Point, and ſink her ſo low into the loathſome Faeculencies of the material World, that (as tho' 'twas the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of her Nature to be ſubſervient to the Body, and uninterruptedly to enjoy the beggarly Delights and Gratifications of Senſuality) ſhe openly Proſecutes the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:52696:43"/>
Entertainments of the Divine Life with all the Expreſſions of Rudeneſs and Diſdain, and ſhameleſly chooſeth that for her Portion and Inheritance, which is the particular and diſcriminating Curſe of the Serpent: <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon thy Belly ſhalt thou go, and Duſt ſhalt thou eat all the days of thy life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But now as the ſcanty diſproportionate Enjoyments of Senſe naturally debaſe and impoveriſh the Soul, ſo do the Contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſpiritual Objects unconceivably im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove and enlarge all her Faculties. As when <hi>Moſes</hi> convers'd with his moſt glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Maker, and the attending Myriads of Holy Ones upon Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> he deriv'd upon his Face ſuch Reflexions of their Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſuch bright and vivid Irradations of their excellent Glory, that the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> could not look ſtedfaſtly upon it; ſo when we frequently meditate upon the noble and exalted Beings of the other World, they naturally dilate and expand all our Faculties, ſublimate and brighten our enlarged Spirits, till they appear like thoſe of their own Company, Beautiful and Majeſtick, as the Sons of the Morning. They raiſe ſuch importunate and inſatiable Deſires, ſuch towring and ſeraphick Aſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the Soul, as will acquieſce and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate only in the bliſsful Enjoyments of
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:52696:43"/>
the Supreme Good, the everlaſting Fruiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his incomprehenſible Glory. The beſt Enjoyments, the nobleſt Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments this World can afford, ſavour of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing now but Dung and Filthineſs to their Palates, which can reliſh nothing but the Dew of Heaven, the ſpiritual Manna, the Food of Angels, thoſe pure and divine Joys which refreſh the Saints above for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more. And thus whereas the Degenerate Soul, which is clogg'd with the Propenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Animal Life, needs no angry Cherub with a flaming Sword to keep her unhallow'd hands from off the Tree of Life, her own corrupted Nature (as the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Pythagorean and Academick have long ſince obſerv'd) being utterly uncapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the Joys of Heaven; this enlarg'd and purify'd Soul, on the contrary, is duly qualify'd for the nobleſt Entertainments of that exalted State. From the Suitableneſs and Congruity of her Faculties with the Objects, ſhe will ſweetly centre upon thoſe intellectual Pleaſures, and moſt amply ſpend all her Powers upon the Infinite and Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Goodneſs, as upon her moſt proper Object, the End of her Being, the Author and Finiſher of her Happineſs and Glory. In a word, She will go away from her earthly Tabernacle ready tun'd to the Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:52696:44"/>
of Heaven, in the firſt moment of her Entrance skilfully ſtrike in with the Quires of Angels, and harmoniouſly raiſe her Voice to the Songs of <hi>Sion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus you have my Reaſons which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force the Exhortation in the Text. I ſhall now briefly deduce from them two or three practical Inferences, and conclude.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Then, You have ſeen how vain, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient, empty, and unſatisfying all the Profits and Pleaſures of this World are: that the whole Earth, tho' chang'd into one Paradiſe, would not be able to yield the Soul Satisfaction; and likewiſe if it could, that ſhe is not certain of enjoying it one minute. Let this Conſideration then teach us to pray with the Excellent <note n="*" place="margin">Vide Simplicii Oratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem apud Jambli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chum ad calcem no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarum.

                  </gap>, to the glorious Realities of the other World, the ſubſtantial Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Life and Immortality.

<pb n="79" facs="tcp:52696:44"/>
Thief approacheth, nor Moth corrupteth, nor Death, which blaſts all our Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments here, interpoſeth; but we ſhall reign Kings and Princes with our God for ever and ever. Let it warn us to be perpetually mindful of our Mortality, and humbly and diligently to wait all the days of our ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed time, till our Change come. In a word, Let it oblige us to forget thoſe things that are behind, and reaching forth unto thoſe things that are before, to preſs with all poſſible Vehemence towards the Mark for the prize of the High Calling of God in Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
               <p n="2">2. You have ſeen how great and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous the Rewards that expect us in the other World are; that they are both proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd to the utmoſt Capacity of the Soul, and alſo will be enjoy'd to all Eternity.

We are all here clouded with Sin and Miſery, and ah! our Vileneſs is upon us. Let us then bear up our Souls
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:52696:45"/>
upon the loftieſt Wing of Divine Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation, and follow our Aſcending Lord above this Darkneſs and miſerable Habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions into the radiant Manſions of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Houſe, the Kingdom of Glory. Let us meditate Day and Night upon that bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed time, when we ſhall have our Feet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Top of Mount <hi>Sion,</hi> and rejoyce in the Felicity of his Choſen, the unfolded and eſſential Glories of his Divine Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, which are too bright for our mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Faculties, and which none can ſee and live.

Let us frequently and ſeriouſly (I ſay) contemplate theſe things, and they will moſt aſſuredly ſo influence our Wills, and fan the Flame of our Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, that we ſhall become perfectly <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>Laſtly, As our future Happineſs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from the Viſion of God, ſo you have ſeen, that without Holineſs no Man can ſee him. Let this then excite us to form and faſhion the Frame of our Minds into a Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Affinity with our Bleſſed Maker. Let it oblige us to prepare our ſelves for the Intuition of his Beauty, to purifie our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as he is pure, and to purge, refine, and ſpiritualize our Nature, that we may be qualify'd for the Poſſeſſion of our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Centre, our home and native Region, the Higheſt Heaven. Let it lead our awak'ned Souls to the Divine Goodneſs and Philanthropy for the Regulation of
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:52696:46"/>
their diſorderly and tumultuous Appetites, and induce them humbly and intenſly to pray at the Throne of Grace, that they may perfect Holineſs in the Fear of God. For when we thus ſincerely deſire to ſhake our ſelves from the Duſt, to ariſe, and put on our beautiful Garments, and to ſee the King in his Beauty, the Glory of the Lord will be revealed to us, and we ſhall cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly behold the Excellency of our God. As the Bridegroom rejoyceth over the Bride, ſolacing himſelf in the ardent and dear Reciprocations of her Love, ſo will our God rejoyce over us. He will be in the midſt of us, he will ſave us, he will rejoyce over us with Joy: He will reſt in his Love, he will rejoyce over us with Sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. He will take away all our Droſs, and for his Name's ſake purifie and cleanſe the Corruptions of our Nature, until the Righteouſneſs thereof go forth as Bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and the Salvation thereof as a Lamp that burneth.

'Twas not <hi>Moſes,</hi> nor one of the Prophets, by whom in times paſt he ſpake unto the Fathers; But when the Fulneſs of the time was come God dealt with us, as the Lord of the Vineyard did with his Husbandmen; laſt of all ſending even his own Son to be his Ambaſſadour to Mankind. His own Son, from whom by the Spirit all thoſe Divine Teachers, which from the Beginning of the World to his Birth went before him in the Fleſh, receiv'd their Power and Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. Of whom <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets were only Types, Fore-runners and Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows; Figures, Miniſters and Subſtitutes, to prepare and enable the World by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees to receive this great Myſtery of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, God manifeſted in the Fleſh: this laſt and univerſal Declaration of Life and Immortality brought to light in his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel. His own Son, who is his only-Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten, Co-eſſential and Co-eternal with himſelf, the Heir of all things, the Lord of Glory, the very Brightneſs of his Fathers Glory, the Expreſs Image of his Perſon, full of Grace and Truth. His own Son, <note n="*" place="margin">Col. 1.16, 17.</note> by whom were all things made, Viſible and Inviſible.

All Thrones, Dominions, Principalities and Powers in Heaven and Earth, as well as the ſubordinate Claſſes of inferiour Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and who ſtill upholds them all by the Word of his Power. This is the Perſon, that comes to Save us. Even He, <note n="†" place="margin">Phil. 2.6, 7.</note> who ſubſiſted in the Form or Nature of God, and therefore thought it no Robbery, but his inviolable Right, to be Equal with God, makes himſelf of no Reputation, but takes upon him the Form or Nature of a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, and is made in the Likeneſs of Men.
<q>Deus Humanâ viſit ſab imagine terras.</q>
God himſelf, I ſay, even the High and Lofty One, that inhabiteth Eternity, and whoſe Name is Great, Wonderful and Holy; the Lord <hi>Jehovah,</hi> with whom is Everlaſting Strength, in very deed bows the Heavens, and comes down to dwell among Men. Well then might the offici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Hoſt of Heaven, the Quires of Angels, who long deſir'd to ſee the Myſtery of this Day uſher in the Birth of this great Prince with Songs and Allelujahs. Well might one of them, cloath'd with the Brightneſs and Similitude of a Star, call the <hi>Levantine</hi>
                  <pb n="87" facs="tcp:52696:48"/>
Princes, the great and Learned <hi>Magi,</hi> as Emblems of his Future Conqueſts over the Princes and Learned Sages of the Heathen World, to do him Obeiſance; and others, wing'd with Joy and Triumph carry theſe glad Tidings to the humble Shepherds, and ſend them likewiſe, as the Firſt-fruits of his own People, to pay their Homage to their Lord. For had the heavenly Hoſt been ſilent, the Loweſt Claſs of Beings, the very ſenſeleſs and inanimate Parts of impatient Nature, had queſtionleſs found a Voice to have told us, That unto us a Son was born, unto us a Child was given, whoſe Government is upon his Shoulders, and whoſe Goings forth from Everlaſting.</p>
               <p>But now how miſerable and wretched was our Captivity which the Arm of Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotence only could lead captive? How thick and diſmal the Darkneſs we were in, which the irreſiſtable Rays of the Sun of Righteouſneſs only could diſperſe and ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter? How weighty and inſupportable that Wrath which nothing could appeaſe, but the adequate Condeſcenſions of an Infinite Love? Where were all thoſe ſpotleſs Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Upper World? Thoſe kind, compaſſionate Spirits, who ſeem to make it a great Part of their Heaven, to relieve us here below? Where all thoſe bright
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:52696:49"/>
Squadrons of exalted Seraphims whoſe Names are renown'd and glorious for their tranſcendent Love in the Habitations of Men here, as well as in the Manſions of Glory? Could not theſe unſtain'd, pure, and undefiled Images of our heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Theſe faultleſs, innocent, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blameable Beings, who continually ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>round his Throne with Anthems of Praiſe, intercede for, and reconcile the offended Deity to Sinful Man? No, we were ſuch heinous Offenders, that nothing leſs than God himſelf, could ſatisfie for our Faults: Theſe Bleſſed Spirits could only in ſtrains of Sorrow lament our Fall, and with a Pity and Concern commenſurate to the paſſible Nature of ſuch happy Beings, expect the Final determination of Infinite Wiſdom, Goodneſs and Juſtice.</p>
               <p>I know many Learned Men, both An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and Modern, are of Opinion, That God might have pardon'd the Sins of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind without any Satisfaction made to his Juſtice, <hi>Solo nutu, &amp; juſſu, &amp; voluntate,</hi> merely by the unexceptionable Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of his Soveraign Will and Power; and that 'twas only to ſhew his great Concern for the Honour of his Laws, and his ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Hatred and Deteſtation of Sin, that he humbled his own Son to become a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiation
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:52696:49"/>
for it. Far be it from me, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trench upon the Divine Omnipotence, or impiouſly to ſay to his Goodneſs, what himſelf does to the Sea; Hitherto ſhalt thou come, but no farther, and here ſhall thy Operations be ſtaid. Yet I think we may venture to affirm, that theſe Excellent Perſons ſeem to be ſo enamour'd with the Beauty, of that lovely Attribute, his Mercy, that they have hardly vouchſaf'd to caſt ſo much as one glance upon his Juſtice. Mercy, I acknowledge, is his Favourite, his darling Excellence; the very Flower and Beauty, as I may ſo ſay, of his Nature, in which his Soul takes moſt Delight and Complacency. And this, conſider'd alone, might have remitted the whole Debt without any payment at all, or at leaſt have accepted the Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of an Angel. But then I conſider on the other hand, that Juſtice is as Eſſential to him as Mercy, and that as the one is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite, ſo is the other too. Now Juſtice (you know) demands the whole Debt ſhould be diſcharg'd, and the Sinner not releas'd till he has one way or other paid the uttermoſt Farthing. But which, I pray, of all the Angels, is ſufficient for theſe things? or where ſhall we find, amongſt thoſe Finite, tho' glorious, Beings, a Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:52696:50"/>
able to ſatisfie Infinite Juſtice for the Sins of the whole World? The Bleſſed Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus look'd and ſaw there was none to help, and wonder'd there was no Interceſſor; therefore his own Arm brought Salvation to him, and his Righteouſneſs it ſuſtain'd him. What I ſay, none of all Created Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, none of the heavenly Powers, thoſe Magiſterial and Maſter-pieces of his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, could Undertake, the Son of God himſelf humbly deſcends from his Throne of Glory even down to his Foot-ſtool, to perform and accompliſh. Welcome then, thrice welcome, Bleſſed Jeſu, into thine own World. Welcome to the unhappy Dwellings of forlorn and helpleſs Man. May the ſenſe of thine infinite Love enlarge thy Dominions, and cauſe all People, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and Languages, to riſe up, and call thee Bleſſed. May all Nations, whom thou haſt made come and worſhip thee, and glorifie thy Name; For thou art Great, and doſt wonderous things, thou art God alone.</p>
               <p>Now then, my Brethren, let us not ſo ill requite this ſtupendous Condeſcenſion of the Son of God, as to debaſe him (as ſome impious and ungrateful Wretches do) beneath the Condition he humbled himſelf unto. Let us not, I ſay, for his infinite
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:52696:50"/>
Love caſt Dirt in his Face; or, becauſe he vouchſaf'd to aſſume the Infirmities of Humane Nature, deſpoil him (as much as we can) of the Glory and Majeſty of the Divine. Though his Beauty was benight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed under a Cloud, there was Form and Comelineſs enough in him, that we ſhould deſire him. The unconverted <note n="*" place="margin">Joſeph. de Antiq. Jud. <hi>l. 18. c. 4.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Jew</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf will tell us, that his Divinity, like the Sun ſhining through a Cloud, gave ſuch Illuſtration and Teſtimony to all his Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that 'twas hardly lawful to call him a Man. And now he has run his Race, and finiſhed his Courſe; the Cloud is remov'd, and the Miſts all ſcatter'd before the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing Sun. The Incarnate God ſhines forth in his full Glory and Triumph; yea, he is now altogether lovely. 'Tis the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Repaſt of Angels, and the peculiar En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment of Glorified Spirits, to behold, admire, and praiſe his excellent Greatneſs; and when our enlarged Souls ſhall fly away to the ſame bliſsful Manſions, and be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Comprehenſions of an intui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Beatitude, they ſhall with equal Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction contemplate his Divine Beauty, and as skilfully tune their Harps to his Praiſes as they. Let us therefore, in the mean time, lay our Hand upon our Mouth, and with all due Proſtration both of Body and
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:52696:51"/>
Mind adore this great Myſtery of Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, this aſtoniſhing Miracle of the Divine Mercy and Condeſcention, which, though above the adequate Comprehenſion of our Reaſon, is put beyond all poſſibility of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſt; being moſt amply confirm'd to us by the concurrent and infallible Teſtimony of God, Angels, and Men.</p>
               <p>At his Baptiſm and Transfiguration, you know, he was proclaim'd by a Voice from Heaven, to be the Beloved Son of God, in whom he was well pleas'd. And again, when he bringeth in his Firſt-begotten into the World, he commands, that this Exina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition of himſelf (this Obſcuration of his Eſſential Glory under the Veil of Humane Fleſh) may not diminiſh one Ray from the Honour of his Divine Majeſty; but that all the Potentates in Heaven and Earth fall down and worſhip him. <hi>Worſhip him,</hi> 
                  <note n="†" place="margin">Pſal. 97.7.</note> ſays he, <hi>all ye Gods, all ye Angels and Thrones in Heaven, all ye Kings and Judges of the Earth.</hi> The holy Angels, with their uſual Chearfulneſs, obey'd the Royal Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. They humbly ador'd the holy Child <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and ſtood ready, through all the Periods of his Life, to Serve and Worſhip him. St. <hi>Peter,</hi> though he ſaw him not ſo clearly as theſe Bleſſed Spirits, generouſly confeſs'd, that he was Chriſt the Son of
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:52696:51"/>
the Living God; and he receiv'd this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation from the Mouth of our Lord him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, That Fleſh and Blood had not reveal'd it unto him, but his Father only, which is in Heaven. Nay (to the everlaſting Shame and Confuſion of the unbelieving Sons of Men) the Devils themſelves have ever ſubſcrib'd to this Article. They knew and confeſs'd him here on Earth, and ſtill be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and tremble. The over-aw'd and trembling <note n="‖" place="margin">Vid. Sui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam in Auguſt.</note> Oracle plainly confeſs'd to the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperour at his Birth, that though he appear'd under all the diſadvantageous Circumſtances of Humanity and Weakneſs, He was the Soveraign Lord and King of the bleſt Beings above; <note n="*" place="margin">Luke 8.28.</note> which was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards confirm'd by a whole Legion of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean Spirits, when in the Man poſſeſs'd they joyntly lifted up their Voices to him with a Jeſus thou Son of God Moſt High. But to what purpoſe, I ſay, was all this? or why all this Noiſe and Oſtentation, had he not been the Son of God in another and more excellent manner than were any of the Sons of Men, who either liv'd with him, or that went before him, had there not been ſomething in it extraordinary, that entitled him to ſo ſublime and divine a Privilege?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="94" facs="tcp:52696:52"/>Angels, Kings, and Prophets (I confeſs) are frequently call'd the Sons of God. They have a larger Participation of his Power, or a Communication of more ſpecial Grace than is indulg'd and granted to his other Children; but yet their Honour and Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity fall infinitely ſhort of that of Jeſus the Son of God. For to which of the Angels ſaid he at any time, Thou art my Son, this Day have I begotten thee? Or who is he amongſt all thoſe exalted Sons of the Moſt High, whom the Father advanc'd to ſit at his own Right-hand till his Enemies are made his Footſtool? <hi>David</hi> (you know) was a King, and yet he calls him Lord; and <hi>John the Baptiſt,</hi> though he was more than a Prophet, was never by Angels, Men, or Devils acknowledg'd to be properly the Son of God: no; theſe are the high Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatives of our Lord Chriſt Jeſus: to him alone belong the moſt glorious and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eminent Titles of his own Son, his only Son, his only Begotten, and the Heir of all things. So that in all things (I ſay) he has the Preheminence.</p>
               <p>But the Scriptures (if poſſible) ſpeak plainer yet. They not only inſtruct by natural and neceſſary Illations and Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences, but alſo (to prevent all Cavils and Diſputes) are careful in many places
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:52696:52"/>
to aſſert this Truth as clearly, and as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly, as Words can ſpeak. <note n="*" place="margin">Joh. 20.28, 29.</note> St. <hi>Thomas</hi> believes and confeſſeth to him, that he is his Lord and God; and thoſe who ſhould afterwards inherit the ſame Faith, are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced Bleſſed. The Beloved <note n="†" place="margin">Joh. 1.1.</note> Diſciple is poſitive, that the Word was God; and in the Cloſe of his firſt Epiſtle ſpeaking of Jeſus, (to ſhew againſt an Objection, which he rightly foreſaw would be after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards urg'd againſt the Chriſtians, that they might ſafely worſhip him, without any Fear or Danger of that Idolatry which the Heathens were guilty of in worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping their <hi>Daemons,)</hi> This, ſays he, is, not <hi>Deus factus,</hi> a made God, a God by Office, not by Nature; but <gap reason="foreign">

He had all along, to the Rage and Amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Enemies, held his peace; ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by his Silence, that he deſpis'd all their Accuſations as certain and apparent Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies. But no ſooner is urg'd to determine this Point, but he opens his Mouth, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cides the matter. <hi>I adjure thee by the living God,</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Mat. 26.63, 64.</note> ſays the High-Prieſt, <hi>that thou tell us whether thou be the Chriſt,</hi> the Son of God. Jeſus, after their modeſt way of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation, ſaith unto him, <hi>Thou haſt ſaid,</hi> Or, as St. <hi>Mark</hi> more poſitively, <hi>Jeſus ſaid, I am.</hi> 'Tis certain, the High-Prieſt underſtood him not in that Vulgar Senſe wherein Great and Righteous Perſons, Kings and Prophets, are call'd the Sons of God; but that he affirm'd himſelf to be ſo in the Literal, Proper, and Natural Signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the words: For otherwiſe he could not, upon the account of this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, have charg'd him with Blaſphemy, nor conſequently the Council have voted him to be guilty of Death. Thus too in the Fifth of St. <hi>John</hi> he tells the <hi>Jews</hi> plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that God is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, his own Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; making himſelf thereby (as they rightly concluded) to be Equal with God. And in another Conference with them in the Tenth of that Evangeliſt, He not only owns himſelf to be the Chriſt, and the Son
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:52696:53"/>
of God in the moſt proper ſence; but adds farther, that He and his Father are One: One, not in Will only, but in Eſſence, Glory, Honour, and Power. I am ſure the <hi>Jews</hi> underſtood him thus: for know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that none could call himſelf the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and natural Son of God, who muſt not aſſert himſelf likewiſe to be God, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing him to be nothing more than a mere Man, they again tax him with Blaſphemy, and go about to ſtone him. <hi>I and my Father,</hi> ſays our Lord, <hi>are One.</hi> Then the <hi>Jews</hi> took up Sones again to ſtone him. Jeſus anſwer'd them Many good Works have I ſhew'd you from my Father; for which of thoſe Works do ye ſtone me? The <hi>Jews</hi> anſwer'd him, ſaying, For a good work we ſtone thee not, but for Blaſphemy, and becauſe that thou, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Man, makeſt thy ſelf God. The <hi>Jews,</hi> I ſay, in theſe places accuſe him of calling himſelf the Son of God in the moſt proper Senſe, and conſequently of making himſelf alſo very God. And yet our Lord is ſo far from traverſing the Indictment, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelling the Crimination, that in Verſ. 38. he confirms their Logick, and then leaves them in this Opinion, which certainly he could never have done without infinite Derogati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from the Honour of the Divine Majeſty,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:52696:54"/>
and downright blaſphemy, had he not really been what they apprehended he ſaid he was: the Proper, Natural, and Only Begotten Son of God.</p>
               <p>Thus, I ſay, is the Divinity of our Lord put beyond all poſſibility of Diſtruſt, being preach'd to all the World by Angels, Prophets, and Apoſtles; Proclaim'd more than once from Heaven by the God of all Truth, the Eternal Father of Angels and men; and alſo moſt poſitively aſſerted in a publick Aſſembly by our Lord himſelf, who, as the <note n="*" place="margin">1 Pet. 2.22.</note>Holy Ghoſt bears him witneſs, <hi>did no Sin, neither was guile found in his mouth.</hi> What need we then, My Brethren, any farther witneſs?

whole Stream of Antiquity runs againſt him; and, that of all the Primitive Fathers and Councils, there is not ſo much as one that any way countenanceth his Opinion. So that you ſee, from all hands, that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs with a truly Satanical Pride we exalt our ſelves above all that is called God, and flatly give Heaven and Earth, God, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, and pious Men the Lye to their face, and ſide only with Jews, Turks, and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans, we muſt acknowledge the Bleſſed Jeſus to be in very deed no other than the Only-Begotten Son of the Moſt High, the Maker of All things, the King of Glory, <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega,</hi> the Firſt of Beings, and the Laſt of Ends, which is, and which was, and which is to come, the Almighty.</p>
               <p>Thus then does the Greatneſs of our Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation appear from the Greatneſs and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty of the Perſon undertaking it. It does ſo</p>
               <p n="2">2. From the Greatneſs and Unconceiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs of thoſe Sufferings, whereby he did accompliſh it. Some, indeed, leſſen the Sufferings of our Lord, by thinking he had the Comprehenſion of Bleſſedneſs, the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports of actual Glory in the midſt of all his Torments; that even then he did behold the Face of God, and communicate in Glory. But in anſwer to Men of theſe
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:52696:56"/>
Thoughts, I conſider with the Excellent Biſhop <note n="*" place="margin">Great Exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plar, <hi>pag. 413, 414.</hi>

               </p>
               <p n="1">1. That though the two Natures of Chriſt were knit by a myſterious Union in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to one Perſon, yet the Natures ſtill retain'd their incommunicable Properties; ſo that as the Divine Nature could not by vertue of this Union derive upon it ſelf the Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities of the Humane, ſo neither did the Humane partake in all Inſtances of the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licities of the Divine: theſe indeed being eſſentially in God, but to Man communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated without Neceſſity, and by an arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Diſpenſation. Tho' therefore, as God, he is omniſcient, and knows every thing; yet that, as Man, he was ignorant as many things, ſeeking Fruit upon the Fig-tree when the time of Figs was not come, and telling us himſelf, that he knew not the Day nor the Hour when he ſhould judge the World; and therefore being ſaid to have increas'd in Wiſdom and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. Though, as God, he is from Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting, and World without end; yet that, as Man, he had a Beginning in the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions of time. Laſtly, Though, as God, 'twas impoſſible for him to ſuffer, yet that, as Man, he was the Subject of Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Miſery.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="103" facs="tcp:52696:56"/>2. That ſome Virtues and Excellencies were then in the Soul of Jeſus, which are not conſiſtent with a glorify'd State; ſuch as Hope, Holy Deſires, and the like: All which having their Seat in the Soul, do ſuppoſe her yet in a ſtate of Pilgrimage; a Condition, that is imperfect, and in order to ſomething beyond what is preſent, it being impoſſible (as St. <hi>Paul</hi> obſerves) for a Man to hope for that which he alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſees and enjoys.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That this Opinion annuls and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroys the whole Merit of his Sufferings. For the leaſt glympſe of Glory, the minu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Ray of Beatifick Viſion, out-weighs the greateſt Calamities, and infinitely exceeds all that Spirit of Pain that can be extracted from the Infelicities of this World. But the Holy Scriptures everywhere aſſure us, that his Paſſion upon the Croſs was a ſtate of Merit and Work, and that as a Reward of it, he was crown'd with Glory and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality. <hi>We ſee Jeſus,</hi> ſays the <note n="*" place="margin">Heb. 2.9.</note> Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, <hi>who was made a little lower than the Angels, for the ſuffering of Death crowned with glory and honour.</hi> And <note n="‖" place="margin">Phil. 2.8, 9.</note> again, <hi>Chriſt humbled himſelf, and became obedient to Death, even the Death of the Croſs. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God alſo hath highly exalted him, and given him a Name which is above every
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:52696:57"/>
Name.</hi> For his Sufferings (you ſee) his Name was exalted, his Kingdom glorify'd, and his Humanity advanc'd above all the Orders of Angels. For theſe he was made the Lord of all the Creatures, the Firſt-fruits of the Reſurrection, the Exemplar of Glory, the Prince and Head of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church: And therefore ſince all this was his Recompence, the Reward of his Sufferings, it could not be a neceſſary Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence and natural Efflux of the Perſonal Union of the Godhead with the Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
               <p>On the other hand there are who affirm, that the Soul of Jeſus upon the Croſs ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered the Pains of Hell, and all the Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Damn'd; and that without ſuch Sufferings, it is not imaginable he ſhould pay the Price which God's Wrath did demand of us. But the ſame that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves the former, does likewiſe reprehend theſe latter. For the Hope, which was the ſupport of his Soul in the midſt of its Ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, as it confeſſeth an Imperfection, that is not conſiſtent with the ſtate of Glory, ſo does it exclude that Deſpair which is the Sting and Torment of accurſed Souls. Our deareſt Lord ſuffer'd indeed the whole Condition of Humanity, Sin only except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and by thoſe ſad Pains he endur'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:52696:57"/>
the Croſs, merited Heaven for himſelf as the Head, and for all his faithful Servants as the Members of his Myſtical Body. But yet (I ſay) we cannot conceive that he was ever under the Amazement of Hell, or that upon the Croſs he felt the formal Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery and Spirit of Pain, which is the Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Damned Spirits, becauſe 'twas im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible he ſhould deſpair, and without De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair 'tis impoſſible there ſhould be a Hell.</p>
               <p>But though I can by no means ſubſcribe to this Aſſertion; yet I think 'tis highly probable, that in the Intention of Degrees and preſent Anguiſh the Soul of our Lord upon the Croſs might feel a greater Load of Wrath than is incumbent in every in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant upon periſhing Souls. S. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, that every Sinner, as ſuch, carries no leſs a Load about with him than a whole Body of Death. How many Deaths then, and unconceivable Agonies, muſt the Lamb of God have felt, when (as the Prophet ſpeaks) the Lord laid on him the Iniquities of us all? Certainly the lively Senſe of united, concentred Vengeance due to the Sins of the whole World, and the vaſt and ſingular Capacity of his Soul who was the Word in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnate, rendred his Sufferings moſt ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing and inſupportable. His Agony was ſo great, that it compell'd him, for a time,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:52696:58"/>
almoſt to deſpair, and ſink under its weight. Sure we are, it extorted from him this moſt bitter Cry, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me</hi>? And how inſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table muſt thoſe Sufferings have been, which could appear even to ſtagger ſuch a Faith, and to eclipſe his Aſſurance of the Preſence and Love of his Heavenly Father?</p>
               <p>But now again, How great is the Bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of that Death, the reſcuing us from which, brought ſo much Shame, and Pain, and Amazement upon the Son of God? How unparalell'd and unconceivably great that Salvation, in the purchaſing of which the Lord of Hoſts himſelf did even bleed and die? The Waters of Bitterneſs (you ſee) entred his Soul, and the Storms of Death and of his Father's Anger broke him all in pieces. But if this was done in the Green Tree, what without this would have been done in the Dry? If (I ſay) the Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of our Lord, who was the Son of God and innocent, who was all fair, and had no ſpot in him, were ſo ſad and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable, then how amazing and inſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable had our Portion been without this Atonement, whom Sin had rendred his profeſs'd Enemies; and, as it were, fitted and mark'd out as Fewel for everlaſting Burnings? But,</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="107" facs="tcp:52696:58"/>3. The Greatneſs of our Salvation ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, in that it frees us from the Bondage and Slavery of the Law. This was a grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous and ſervile Diſpenſation, conſiſting of innumerable little Rites and Ceremonies, which had no intrinſick Value in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and are therefore ſaid by God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be Statutes that were not good; but were only adapted for a time to the weak Capacities and babe-like Humours of the <hi>Jews.</hi> Of Rites and Ceremonies, I ſay, ſo heavy and burdenſome, that the Apoſtles themſelves complained, that 'twas a Yoke upon their Necks, which neither they nor their Forefathers were ever able to bear. But now has Chriſt taken this Yoke from off our Necks, and made out a way for us into the Liberty of the Sons of God. He deals no longer with us as with Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in our Minority, but has deliver'd us from the Tutorage and Paedagogy of the Law, from the Severity of its Commands, from the exact Punctilio's and Numerouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of its Impoſition. The new Moons and Sabbatical Years, the many Waſhings and Purifications ſtand us in no ſtead; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are we oblig'd to long and tedious Journeys to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> to preſent our Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations and Sacrifices at the Temple. Chriſt our Paſſover having been ſacrificed for us,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:52696:59"/>
and the Meſſiah cut off, all thoſe typical Oblations and Sacrifices muſt for ever ceaſe, the Shadow give place to the Subſtance, thoſe Ritual Obſervances to Natural and Moral Duties, thoſe Carnal Ceremonies to the Spiritual Worſhip, and that Tempora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Diſpenſation to the Everlaſting Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of the Goſpel. Circumciſion now avails no more than Uncircumciſion, and 'tis neither Meat nor Drink, but a new Creature only, that commends a Man to God. In a word, our Duty is no longer clogg'd with a company of uſeleſs and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome Ceremonies, but (like the Servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the ancient Patriarchs) is more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie and acceptable, more plain and ſimple, more humane and natural, more becoming the Grandure and Majeſty of the Divine Being, and, more agreeable to the Nature of a ſpiritual and immortal Soul. 'Tis on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be happy the moſt proper and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendious way; to love our bleſſed Maker for himſelf, and our Neighbours for his ſake; to viſit the Fatherleſs and Widows in their Afflictions, and to keep our ſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpotted from the World. All which, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if we conſider the extraordinary In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence of Divine Aſſiſtance, which we now enjoy, render our Salvation Great, Wonderful, and Glorious. And ſo I come
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:52696:59"/>
to my Fourth Particular, which is to ſhew, the Greatneſs of our Salvation, from the Conſideration of thoſe greater Aids of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Grace, thoſe particular Mercies we now enjoy under the Diſpenſation of the Goſpel, whereby we may be freed both from the Guilt and Puniſhment, and alſo from the Power and Dominion of Sin.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Now the Law only diſcovers Sin, but affords no degrees of ſupernatural Power to ſubdue it; but with the Preaching of the Goſpel the Holy Ghoſt was ſent down from Heaven, who by illuminating, preventing, and exciting Grace aſſiſts Men to perform the Conditions of Salvation, and is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd in rich and liberal Supplies to all that humbly and ardently pray for him. God now pours Water upon him that is thirſty, and Floods upon the dry Ground; he pours out his Spirit upon our Seed, and his Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing upon our Off-ſpring, whereby they may ſpring up as among the Graſs, as Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows by the Water-courſes. The Law di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects to no means for the Expiation of Guilt, but peremptorily and dogmatically denounceth Death to all Offenders. The Soul that ſins ſhall die. But the Goſpel delivers us from this terrible Sentence of the Law, and allows a Renovation of the Sinner by Repentance, to which the ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:52696:60"/>
Pardon of Sin is aſſured. <hi>Waſh ye,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iſ. 1.16, 17, 18.</note> 
                  <hi>make ye clean,</hi> ſays God by his Evangelical Prophet, <hi>put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes; ceaſe to do evil, learn to do well, and though your Sins be as ſcarlet, they ſhall be as white as ſnow; though they be red like Crimſon, they ſhall be as wool.</hi> God indeed will not pardon thoſe who flatter themſelves in their Sins; but they who confeſs and forſake them ſhall find Mercy. The Law exacts abſolute perfect, uninterrupted Obedience; and for the leaſt Omiſſion or accuſing Act, paſt an irrevocable Doom upon the Offender: <hi>Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed is the man that continues not in a things written in the Law, to do them.</hi> But the Goſpel mitigates and allays this Strictneſs and Severity; calls only for ſincere and perſevering, though imperfect Obedience, and propounds ſuch merciful Conditions to the guilty, that upon the performance of them they may plead their Pardon ſeal'd with the Blood of their Redeemer, to be ſav'd and crown'd in the Day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>And thus whereas the Law worketh no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Wrath, being as terrible in its In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions, as 'twas at firſt in its Promulga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; the Kingdom of Heaven, the Goſpel of Peace, addreſſeth it ſelf to us after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:52696:60"/>
manner. It ſpeaks to us in a ſtill, ſmall Voice; the whole Tenour of it (you ſee) running in this gentle ſtrain, Sin no more; Repent and be converted; Come to Chriſt, and be refreſh'd, and find Reſt unto your Souls. The Grace of God, I ſay, which bringeth Salvation, doth thus appear, teaching us, that if the time paſt of our Lives ſhall ſuffice us to have wrought the Will of the Gentiles, and we will now in good earneſt renounce all our ungodly and worldly Luſts, and take care for the time to come faithfully to diſcharge our Duty to God, our Neighbour, and Our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, to live ſoberly, righteouſly, and godly in this preſent World, Sin ſhall not have Dominion over us, God having ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd himſelf by expreſs Promiſe, that he will not ſuffer us to be tempted above what we are able, but that in all our Temptations he will make a way for us to eſcape, that we may be able to bear them. So that though Sin is not entirely deſtroy'd, (that being the Privilege of Angels and Souls freed from the Fetters of Mortality) yet (as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of its Effect, Death) it has loſt its Sting, and is only inſtrumental to the Advancement of the Glory of God, who upon our ſincere and hearty Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and Reformation of our Lives, will
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:52696:61"/>
pardon all our paſt Offences, though never ſo many and great in themſelves; and for thoſe daily Failures, thoſe Sins of Infirmity, thoſe Lapſes of Humane Nature, which the Beſt of Men muſt more or leſs be ſubject to, as long as they lie under the Diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of Mortality, will put them all upon the Score of the Croſs.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The Greatneſs of the Salvation wrought for us by Chriſt, appears, in that he has deliver'd us from that Ignorance and Darkneſs which the whole World lay in at his Coming. Both Jews and Gentiles (I confeſs) had ſome Notices or Conception<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> of a Future State; but then they were ſo miſerably intricate and obſcure, ſo confus'd and uncertain, that they were very little better than none at all. Thoſe moſt Think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Learned Pagans, the <hi>Pythagoreans</hi> and <hi>Platoniſts,</hi> after the moſt diligent Search and Enquiry into theſe Matters, could never advance beyond a Probability: all their fine Harangues and rapturous Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes upon the Immortality of the Soul, being Indications rather of their good Wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, than Demonſtrations of its Reality. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> not only wavers and fluctuates in his Opinion, but alſo Problematically diſputes againſt it; though it muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs'd, that in his Book <hi>De Animâ</hi> he ſtiles
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:52696:61"/>
her, without any ſcruple, Eternal and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal. But the <hi>Stoicks</hi> are as Dogmatical in this Point as in any other. Sometimes indeed they talk like Abſtracted Beings or pure Intelligences, with the nobleſt Flights of Rhetorick and Fancy decyphering the Exalted Happineſs of the Soul when ſhe is entirely looſned from the Clogs of Matter, and freely roves up and down in the pure unmixed Regions of Light and Glory. But then (as though they had lain all this while in a Trance, and had only been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained with the fantaſtick illuſive Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentations of a ſportive Imagination) they for the moſt part peremptorily deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, That Death is not only the Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Soul from the Body, but the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Diſſolution likewiſe, or Diſſipation of both; there being no more after the Death of a Man than was before his Birth, <hi>viz.</hi> Emptineſs, Inſenſibility, and Darkneſs: Nay, when in their abſtracted Humours they vouchſafe to allow her a Subſiſtence without the Body, 'tis only till the next Univerſal Conflagration, when ſhe and all Created Beings muſt End and Die toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Nor indeed was the Confeſſion of that great Maſter of Morality, <hi>Socrates</hi> himſelf, much better; for, concluding his gallant and moſt excellent Apology before
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:52696:62"/>
the <hi>Areopagites,</hi> with ſome glorious Refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions upon the ineſtimable Happineſs of Good Men in the other World, he in the very laſt Words daſh'd all with an open un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſguis'd Acknowledgment of his remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Doubts and Jealouſies.<note place="margin">Sub finem Apol. apud Platonem.</note>

               <p>And then for the <hi>Jews,</hi> at the time of our Saviour's Coming, they ſtood much upon the ſame Level: For, though from the Tranſlation of <hi>Enoch</hi> and <hi>Elias,</hi> and the Death of their Patriarchs, who never inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited the Promiſes of Temporal Felicity, and particularly that of <hi>Moſes,</hi> which their Rabbins are pleas'd to call The Kiſs of
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:52696:62"/>
God's Mouth, intimating thereby, that he breathed out his Soul by the Force and Energy of Contemplation; without thoſe Pains and Convulſions which are the uſual Concomitants of the Death of other Men, reſolving himſelf into the Embraces of his Maker: From the poſitive and expreſs Words of <hi>Job,</hi> which (however ſome Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Commentators are pleas'd to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand them) are, I conceive with S. <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom</hi> and the Ancients, as plain and clear a Confeſſion of the Reſurrection, as any that have been made ſince the Promulgati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Goſpel: From the glorious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of that excellent Woman and her ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Children in the <hi>Maccabees,</hi> who all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd Deliverance, that they might obtain a better Reſurrection: and from thoſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Promiſes of Eternal Life ſcatter'd up and down in the Book of <hi>Pſalms,</hi> and other Writings of the Old Teſtament. Though (I ſay) from all theſe one might reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly expect the <hi>Jews</hi> ſhould have had ſome fuller and clearer Knowledge of the State after Death; yet being no part of that Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant which (if ſtrictly conſidered as made with that People at Mount <hi>Sinai)</hi> was foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded only upon Temporal Promiſes; Peace, Long Life, Plenty, and Proſperity in their own Land, they had generally no other
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:52696:63"/>
Effect, than that they were believ'd to be the Reward of Men of Heroick and Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Piety. Nay, their unaccountable Blindneſs and Unattention to the Faith and Manners of their Fathers, who did all eat the ſame ſpiritual Meat, and did all drink the ſame Spiritual Drink, as we Chriſtians do, occaſion'd ſo many Cavils and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes amongſt them, that the <hi>Sadduces</hi> peremptorily deny'd it; not only, decry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Reſurrection of the Dead, but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming likewiſe, with the foremention'd <hi>Epicureans,</hi> that the Souls of Men did pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh together with the Body.

Songs of Joy and Triumph in its mouth, to the Object of its Happineſs, the God that gave it. Nay, the faithful Chriſtians, the true Lovers of Jeſus, who have taſted the Goodneſs of the Lord, and long conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd and well weighed the incomparable Difference between the mean, imperfect, frail Felicities of this preſent World, and the ſubſtantial, ſolid, immutable Glories of that which is to come, muſt certainly cry out with the inflamed <note n="*" place="margin">Cant. 1.4.</note> Spouſe, <hi>Draw us, and we will run after thee:</hi> O! looſen our Affections from this World, that we may readily aſcend to thee. Their longing Souls will renew the paſſionate Sighs of the Exil'd Prophet, <hi>O when ſhall we come and appear before the preſence of God!</hi> How welcome muſt Death be to them, when it comes (as it were) with Olive-branches in its hands to offer them Peace? to ſet them at perfect Liberty from the Bondage of Corruption, the Servitude and Thraldom of their mortal Bodies? They know their happy Souls will be immediately convey'd by Angels into the Preſence of their Savior, and by him preſented to his Father without Spot or Wrinkle, inveſted with his Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, compleat in his Holineſs, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd and qualified for an Everlaſting Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with him in Glory. That they

are the Reward of his Sufferings, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and dear Purchaſe of his Blood, and therefore that they ſhall be joyfully recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved into Heaven by him, who will then ſee the glorious Effects of the Travail of his Soul, and be ſatisfied. That the Angels, who rejoyc'd at their Converſion, will much more do ſo at their Glorification; and the Church of the Firſt-born, who have before them entred into Glory, have a new Acceſſion of Joy, to ſee them ſafely arriv'd at the ſame undefil'd and immortal Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. Theſe things (I ſay) thus duly conſidered, muſt needs inſpire them with Courage and Alacrity, and enable them chearfully to lay down their Bodies, that they may aſcend to the Seat of Bleſſedneſs, this happy Society above, that inſpires mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Endearments and Joys for evermore. I am ſure 'twas thus with the Primitive Chriſtians. S. <hi>Paul,</hi> with the moſt earneſt Affections and paſſionate Zeal, deſir'd to depart hence, to leave the tranſitory, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfying Pleaſures of this Life, to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd and to be with Chriſt; and the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs with all imaginable Boldneſs and Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry encountred Death, that interpos'd between them and Glory. They as wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly left their Bodies, as <hi>Elias</hi> let fall his Mantle, to aſcend into Heaven.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="121" facs="tcp:52696:65"/>Some indeed of theſe excellent Perſons (as <note n="‖" place="margin">Hom. 8.</note> S. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> tells us) went to Death with many Appearances of Fear. When they heard the wild Beaſts roar, they were ſtruck with Horror: At the ſight of the Executioners and the Inſtruments of Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, they were pale and trembling. The Fleſh ſeem'd to cry out, O! Let this Cup paſs from me. But theſe, alas! were but the little ineffectual Struglings of innocent Nature, which, though weak and faint, follow'd the Spirit, and corrected its own Deſire with, Not my Will, but thine be done. As the Moon in Eclipſe, though obſcure, goes on in a Regular Courſe, as when 'tis full of Light by the Reflection of the Sun; ſo theſe Chriſtian Heroes, though as it were, forſaken and depriv'd of the kind Influences of the Spirit, the bright Beams and Irradiations of Divine Comfort, perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd notwithſtanding in their Regular Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the reſolute and undaunted Profeſſion of the Truth. No Torments could force them to renounce their Saviour; no Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of Death to warp from the Profeſſion of their Faith; but the Conſideration of that eternal weight of Glory, which after a ſhort night of Sorrow and Heavineſs they ſhould receive in the Inheritance of the Saints in Light, enabled them at length to
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:52696:66"/>
overcome their Fears, and in ſpight of all the Reluctancy of Nature, to keep the Command of God, and the Faith of Jeſus. Thus the Stars fall down from Heaven, and Clods of Earth aſcend and ſhine in the Firmament. The Angels, that excell'd in Strength and Knowledge, kept not their ſtate of Purity and Glory, but are ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſunk down into Corruption and Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: but theſe humble Believers, though weak and encompaſs'd with many Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, were preſerved by the Blood of Jeſus from deſtructive Evil, from the Fear of the Firſt, and the Power of the Second Death, paſſing undauntedly through the Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the King of Terrors to their Fathers Kingdom, where with all the Company of Holy Angels and Beatified Souls, they now lie infolded in the Circles of Peace and Joy, expecting the Conſummation of Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſs, the Redemption of their Bodies in the joyful and glorious Morning of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection. Which brings me to my Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth and Laſt Particular, which is to ſhew the Greatneſs of the Salvation wrought for us by Chriſt, in that he has not only me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited the Salvation of our Souls, but the Redemption likewiſe, or the Reſurrection, of our Bodies.</p>
               <p n="7">
                  <pb n="123" facs="tcp:52696:66"/>7. Of all the Chriſtian Doctrines, this was ever eſteemed the moſt incredible; and has accordingly, in all Ages, met with the greateſt Oppoſition. The Learned Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens generally look'd upon the Body as the Priſon, the Dungeon, and Sepulchre of the Soul, and therefore do not ſtick to affirm, That for a ſeparated Soul to return into a Body, is to undergo a ſecond Death. Nay, that famous Rabbin <hi>Ben Maimon</hi> was of the ſame Perſwaſion; it being a known Aphoriſm of his in his Great Work, That in the World to come (or ſtate of conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate Happineſs) there ſhall be nothing but pure Incorporeity. This engag'd them to employ all their Learning and Parts to repreſent this Doctrine as a monſtrous and ridiculous Paradox, not fit to be embrac'd by any of the genuine Sons of Wiſdom and Learning. Accordingly we find St. <hi>Paul</hi> was counted mad by <hi>Feſtus,</hi> and but a Bab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler at beſt by the great Wits at <hi>Athens,</hi> for venturing to preach to them Jeſus and his Reſurrection: and it chiefly ſtomachs the Heathen in <hi>Minutius Felix,</hi> that the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians ſhould peremptorily aſſert the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the Body, which every Eye ſaw to be ſubject to Corruption; and yet at the ſame time threaten Ruin and Deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Heavenly Bodies, which the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality

But what if theſe Men believe not? Shall their Unbelief make the Faith of God of none effect? God forbid. Yea let God be true (as the Apoſtle ſpeaks) though every Man a Lyar.

               </p>
               <p>And thus I have diſcharg'd my firſt Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Head, which was, to ſhew the Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Salvation wrought for us by Chriſt. I now proceed to my Second, which is, very briefly to lay before you our Inexcuſableneſs, and the intolerable Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravations of our Guilt and Puniſhment, if we neglect it. <hi>How ſhall we eſcape,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Then, we ſhall be utterly inexcuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and intolerably aggravate our Guilt and Puniſhment, if we neglect this great Salvation which Chriſt hath wrought for us, becauſe we ſhall be entirely deſtitute of the mollifying Circumſtances and Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of Ignorance. Whilſt Men had lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle or no Underſtanding, but walk'd on ſtill in Darkneſs, 'twas no wonder that the Foundations of the Moral, as well as of the Intellectual World, were out of courſe. Their broken Notices of another State, and beggarly Conceptions of its Delights and Entertainments, induc'd them rather to let looſe the Reins to their Intemperance, than to correct and retrench the Luxuriancy of
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:52696:68"/>
their Vices. A more delicious <hi>Canaan,</hi> the Fields and Groves of <hi>Elyſium,</hi> and a <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metan</hi> Paradiſe, naturally lead Men to an unbounded Gratification of their ſenſual Appetites, as to that which is the End and Perfection of their Beings, their ultimate Portion in the Regions of Eternity. So that a truly moral Man, with ſuch Perſwaſions about him, would be an Object equally ſtrange and ſurprizing, as Fewel or dry Stubble, that will not take fire in the midſt of a burning firy Furnace.</p>
               <p>But now with Chriſtians is the Caſe quite otherwiſe. We know for certain both the Exiſtence and Nature of the other State. That for pure and holy Souls, who are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely cleans'd from the Stains and Polluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of corrupted Nature, and rais'd to the Poſſeſſion of their Primitive Brightneſs, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains a moſt glorious and undefil'd Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, Entertainments moſt agreeable to their enlarged Faculties, exalted and divine Joys for evermore. That for impure and ſenſual Souls, on the contrary, who fight under the Banner of the World and the Fleſh, forſaking God that made them, and lightly eſteeming the Rock of their Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is prepar'd a Worm that will never die, and a Fire that will ne'er be quench'd. We know (I ſay) that Refin'd and Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:52696:69"/>
Souls will be receiv'd into ſerene undi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbed Manſions of everlaſting Happineſs, the City of the Living God, the Heavenly Jeruſalem, where, with all the ſhining and innumerable Companies of Holy Angels, they ſhall for ever behold and praiſe the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folded Beauties of their God and Saviour. That on the other hand there are ſad, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfortable Regions of Darkneſs and Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, where Fire and Brimſtone, Storms and Tempeſts, will be the lamentable and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Portion of the Ungodly. Fire and Brimſtone, to poſſeſs, inflame, and torment their Bodies; and the Storms and Tempeſts of an enraged Conſcience impetuouſly to hurry their awak'ned Souls through all the unhappy Stages of that woful Eternity. If we then dare to commit Wickedneſs, who have received this clear Knowledge of its ſad Effects and Conſequences; that it cuts off all our hopes of the Glories of Heaven, and irrevocably condemns us to the uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable Agonies and Amazements of Hell; we put our ſelves beyond all poſſibility of Excuſe, and (as our Saviour himſelf aſſures us) unmeaſurably enhanſe the Severities of our Condemnation. <hi>This is the Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Joh. 3.19.</note> ſays he with an Emphaſis, <hi>i. e.</hi> the higheſt, the greateſt, the moſt intolerable Condemnation, <hi>that when Light is come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:52696:69"/>
the World, Men love Darkneſs rather than Light.</hi> In a word, God may vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe to wink at the times of Ignorance, and graciouſly overlook the unhappy Miſcarri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages of the unenlightned World: He may be favourable to the Servant that knows not his Will, and therefore does unwitting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things worthy of Stripes: But Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, who know their Lord's Will, and yet prepare not themſelves, nor do according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, will have nothing to plead or pretend for their Diſobedience, and therefore will moſt certainly be beaten with many Stripes.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We ſhall be utterly inexcuſable, and intolerably aggravate our Guilt and Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, if we neglect this great Salvation which Chriſt has wrought for us, becauſe we thereby become guilty of the vileſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude. We know the infinite Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to Duty and Gratitude, which our Heavenly Father has laid upon us; all the Stratagems of his Goodneſs, the aſtoniſhing Miracles of Divine Mercy and Condeſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. That he, whom the Virgins, the untainted Beings above adore and love, meekly drew a veil over his Eſſential Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and cloath'd himſelf with Fleſh for the Society of Mankind. That the Eternal, Independent, All-ſufficient One, ſtoop'd down for our ſakes to the loweſt Eſtate of

Uneaſineſs and Need; and the Lord and Governour of all the Kingdoms of the Earth vouchſaf'd to dwell among us, though he ſcarce found a place where to lay his Head.

In a word, The thorough and lively Apprehenſions which they ſhall then have of their Sins and Follies, will ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe and enrage them, that they'll be all in a flame with Fury and Indignation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt themſelves, weeping, and wailing, and gnaſhing their Teeth; always, as it were, uon a Rack, without any Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of their Pains and Anguiſh, diſtor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, afflicted, diſtracted, confounded.</p>
               <p>What then remains, but that, ſince theſe things are ſo, we ſeriouſly take our Caſe into Conſideration? That ſince our Burden is lighter than that of <hi>Jews</hi> or <hi>Gentiles,</hi> we
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:52696:72"/>
run with greater Chearfulneſs the ways of God's Commandments? That we grieve not the Holy Spirit, nor turn the Grace of God into Laſciviouſneſs; but that the great, extraordinary Aſſiſtances which we now enjoy under the Goſpel, influence our Wills, direct our Choice, and give Warmth and Vigour to our Affections? That the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Faith and Aſſurance which we have of a Future State, and of its Rewards and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments, work moſt powerfully upon our Minds to conquer all the Temptations of this Life, to deterr us from doing any thing whereby we may forfeit our Crown, and to render us ſtedfaſt, immoveable, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways abounding in the Work of the Lord, foraſmuch as we know, that our Labour will not be in vain in the Lord? and ſince the greateſt Puniſhments imaginable attend our Miſcarriages, that we lift up the hands that hang down, and ſtrengthen the feeble knees, and run with patience the Race that is ſet before us? Let us then look unto Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, the Author and Finiſher of our Faith, and follow his Example, who for the Joy that was ſet before him endur'd the Croſs, deſpis'd the Shame, and is therefore now ſat down at the Right-hand of the Majeſty on High. Let us frequently contemplate his ſtupendious, unfathomable Love in
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:52696:72"/>
vouchſafing to aſſume our Nature; that he, who is Mighty, ſhould ſo debaſe himſelf to magnifie us, and evermore ſay with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flam'd and ſeraphick Virgin, Holy and Bleſſed is his Name. Let us, with her Piety and Devotion, view the Immacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late Lamb of God crown'd with Thorns upon the Croſs: Let us behold him there bleeding and dying for our Sins. Let his unconceivable Agonies ſink deep into our Hearts, and make us to weep bitterly for thoſe Sins which caus'd ſuch Torments to our Deareſt Lord. Let us beſeech him by all that Anguiſh and Amazement his Soul endur'd for our ſakes, never to ſuffer us to crucifie him any more; but that he would be pleas'd to come and take up his Lodging with us, to drive out all thoſe Uſurpers, the World with its Vanities; to make an utter Deſtruction of every <hi>Amala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kite,</hi> and to take to himſelf the entire Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of our Hearts. Let us moſt paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onately intreat him not to ſuffer our im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal Souls, the price of his own Blood, to periſh; but that he would be graciouſly pleas'd to waſh away all their Stains, to cloath them in his white Robe, and ſo to preſent them ſpotleſs and unblameable to our Heavenly Father. Laſtly, If the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of Salvation, and that Eternal too, be
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:52696:73"/>
worthy to be prais'd, let us now begin theſe Songs upon Earth, which will be our happy Employment and Buſineſs in Heaven, with all thoſe glorious Angels and Holy Ten Thouſands that worſhip about the Throne, ſaying, <hi>Bleſſing, and Honour, and Glory, and Power be unto him that fitteth upon the Throne, and unto the Lamb for Ever and Ever.</hi> Amen.

               </p>
               <p n="1">1. From the Nature of God. Was God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ſuch a one as the <hi>Epicureans</hi> fanſi'd him to be; a Being taken up with the Fruition and Contemplation of his own Bleſſedneſs, and that would never vouchſafe to reſpect the humble Addreſſes and Supplications of his moſt faithful Servants, we ſhould have no great reaſon to wonder at that Coldneſs and Indifferency, that lukewarm and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Behaviour which appears ſo viſibly in our Religious Performances. Nay, I could willingly conclude with the Wiſe <note n="*" place="margin">Senec. de Benef. lib. <hi>4.</hi> cap. <hi>4.</hi>
                  </note> Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, that nothing but pure Madneſs could induce Mankind to beſtow any Worſhip at all upon ſuch a Being, who, as though he was deaf as <hi>Baal,</hi> and helpleſs as <hi>Dagon,</hi> after all their Wreſtlings and Importunities would neither hear them, nor help them. But alas! we have no ſuch Pretence or Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfuge for our Impiety. The God whom we ſerve, is indeed that Bleſſedneſs and Eternal Being that reſts upon his own Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, without the Aſſiſtance of any External Object, enjoying infinite Delight and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency from the ſolitary Contemplation
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:52696:75"/>
of his own Eſſential Perfections. He dwells in the high and lofty Place, encircled with ſuch tranſcendent Rays of Light, that the brighteſt Seraphim veil their Faces, and at an awful diſtance adore his inacceſſible Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Yet do Mercy and Goodneſs ſo eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially ſit enthron'd with his glorious Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, that even he, who thus inhabits Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, humbleth himſelf to behold the things that are done both in Heaven and Earth. <hi>The Lord looketh down from Heaven,</hi> ſays the <note n="*" place="margin">Pſal. 33.13.</note> Pſalmiſt, <hi>and beholds all the Children of Men: from the habitation of his Dwelling he conſidereth all them that dwell upon the Earth.</hi> And the Philoſophick Orator, without the help of Revelation, <hi>Sit perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum civibus,</hi> ſays he, and ſo on. <hi>i. e.</hi> Let all the Citizens aſſuredly know, that God takes particular notice what manner of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons we are, with what Mind and Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on we perform the Acts of our Religious Worſhip, and that he will deal with every man according to his Works. He is not a petty Prince,<note place="margin">1 King 20.13, 28.</note> (as the <hi>Syrians</hi> profanely ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd) whoſe Knowledge and Soveraignty are confin'd only to a particular Province; but the Lord moſt High is terrible, he is a great King over all the Earth. Not only the ſhining Inhabitants of the Courts above, the innumerable and invincible Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions

of Glorious Angels, but the inferiour Troops likewiſe of natural Cauſes ſerve un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his Banner, and duly execute his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands. He maketh the Spirits or Winds his Meſſengers, and the flaming Fires his Agents or Miniſters. The Clouds at his Command drop Fatneſs upon the Hills and Mountains, and the Valleys likewiſe by his Bleſſing ſtand in their Seaſon ſo thick with Corn, that they laugh and ſing. Yea, the moſt caſual and ſeemingly fortuitous Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are order'd by his Wiſdom, and the Sun ſees nothing in all his Courſe ſo little and inconſiderable, but what falls under his Care and Providence. He feeds the young Ravens that call upon him; and the Lions roaring after their prey, do ſeek and receive their Meat from God. By him do the Roſe in <hi>Sharon</hi> and the Lily of the Valleys on play their fragrant Beauties? and the airy Choiriſters ſecurely ſit upon the Boughs and ſing, not one of them falling to the ground without our heavenly Father. Yea, the very Hairs of our Head, ſays our Lord, are all numbred. In ſhort, no Space, no Place, exludes his Preſence. He penetrates into the Center of our Spirits; enters the ſecret Chambers, the cloſeſt Receſſes and Retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of our Hearts; yea, and diſcovers all our moſt ſecret Thoughts and Imaginations
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:52696:76"/>
long before we our ſelves do, even before they are. He is about our Paths, and about our Beds, and ſpies out all our ways.</p>
               <p>Now then, conſidering the Nature of God, how ought our Souls, think ye, to be employ'd in his Worſhip and Service? Is this God, whoſe Majeſty fills Heaven and Earth, to be approach'd with flat and tepid Devotions? Is he fond of trifling imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Ceremonies? or to be pleas'd with Lip-Devotion and complemental Addreſſes? Certainly no. The Lame and the Blind (ſays the Prophet) ſuch impotent,<note place="margin">Mal. 1.8.</note> imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Services, if offer'd to an Earthly Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour, would moſt aſſuredly be rejected; much leſs then can they be grateful <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

The matchleſs Excellency of his Nature (as many Learned Pagans have obſerv'd) calls for our beſt and nobleſt Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances, neither will he accept of any thing leſs than the Cream, the Flower and Strength of our Reaſon. We muſt nor pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to honour him with our Lips, when our Hearts are far from him; but always approach him with the deepeſt Awe, Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, and Admiration; love and deſire him (as an exact and learned <note n="†" place="margin">Mr. <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi> in his Reaſ. and Rel. pag. 39.</note> Author

to my Second Conſideration, which is, to repreſent to you the Reaſonableneſs of the Exhortation contain'd in the Text, from the Nature of our own Souls.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Sad indeed and deplorable are the Decays of our Primitive Beauty, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable the Ruins of our Original Frame. God made Man upright; his whole Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution was beautiful and harmonious, and his Soul (drawn, as it were, by the central Force of her native Seat) mov'd naturally towards Heaven. But if we view him in his preſent Condition, <hi>Quantum mutatus ab illo eſt!</hi> how is this glorious Creature chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged! Clouds and Darkneſs (if I may ſo ſpeak) are continually round about him: Confuſion and Diſorder are the Habitation of his Seat. His Underſtanding is dark and cloudy; his Will crooked and perverſe; and he is become a ſtrange Contradiction to himſelf; being not able to do the things that he would. Wars and Tumults, inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine Broils and Commotions, ruffle and diſcompoſe him, and there is a Law in his Members impetuouſly fighting againſt, and frequently bringing into Captivity the Law of the Mind.</p>
               <p>But though the Soul is thus ſhamefully fallen from her Primitive State of Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and Perfection; yet, how glorious is
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:52696:78"/>
ſhe ſtill in compariſon of all the Creatures that are round about her? The glimmering Remains of her original Beauty, the very Twilight of her native Luſtre and Bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, appears ſo wonderful and dazling, that ſhe is ſtill but a few degrees below the Angels of God. How ſwift are her Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? how nimble her Thoughts? how brisk and active her Operations and Refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions? The ſwifteſt Morning-Ray paſſeth not ſo ſoon from Eaſt to Weſt, as ſhe flies through all the Airy Regions into the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Heavens, and thence again deſcends through all the Ethereal Plains, to contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate in their various Manſions the Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip of her Maker. How exalted are her Aſpirations? how boundleſs her De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires? how vaſtly large and comprehenſive her Capacities? She weighs all the Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies of Nature in a Balance, and finds them wanting: her Appetites and Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions being no more to be ſatisfied with any Created Good, than an hungry Stomach with wiſe Sayings or excellent Diagrams.</p>
               <p>But now has God enrich'd our Minds with theſe noble Powers to proſecute the Delights or Intereſts of this World, and to beſtow ſome faſhionable and perfunctory Attendance only on his Service and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience? No, theſe vaſt, capacious Spirits,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:52696:78"/>
that can take in and lodge ſo many Truths together without Confuſion or Diſorder; that are ſo reſtleſs and indefatigable in their Search after Happineſs, and can no where acquieſce, or terminate their Deſires upon any Created Good, are deſign'd for the higheſt and moſt exalted Entertainments. Not for theſe diſproportionate Objects of Senſe, the faeculent Pleaſures of the Body, (which the contracted Faculties of Brutes are able even in their utmoſt Intention to comprehend) but for Joys truly Angelical and Divine; for Communion and Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with God himſelf by Prayers and Prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes here, and for the moſt intimate Fruition of his Beatifick and Eſſential Glories in Heaven hereafter. How unworthily then do we behave our ſelves towards them, when we decoy them down into earthly Enjoyments? How do we cramp and ſtreighten their Faculties? contract and leſſen their aſpiring Strength and Vivacity? Their natural Motion, you ſee, is towards Heaven, and they graſp at nothing leſs than Glory, and Honour, and Immortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Let us not then confine them to the Earth, when they are ready to take Wing, and fly towards Heaven. Let us not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlave them to poor and beggarly Objects, when their Capacities diſpoſe them for the
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:52696:79"/>
Fruition of the Beſt Being, the Life of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels. When through the Aſſiſtances of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion they are advanc'd to their true Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, they'll immediately aſcend above the Magnetiſm of ſecular Entertainments. They will then be poſſeſt with ſuch lively and raviſhing Apprehenſions of the Divine Beauty, as will oblige them, for his ſake, utterly to diſcard and renounce all their other Loves. Though there be threeſcore Queens, and fourſcore Concubines, and Virgins without number, yet their Love, their Undefil'd, will be but one. In a word, They'll collect and concenter all the ſcatter'd Rays of their Affections into this one Point, delight and ſolace them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves only in the Lord their God, and ſing and give Praiſe to him with Fervour and Alacrity as the Angels do, who joyfully wait his Call, and ſtand with Wings ſtretch'd out, ready to fly when he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands.</p>
               <p n="3">3. I am to repreſent to you the Reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs of the Exhortation contain'd in the Text, from the Conſideration of the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendent and ineſtimable Value of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards that attend us. <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="149" facs="tcp:52696:79"/>
'tis for a Kingdom and for Liberty; for the Liberty even of the Sons of God, and for the Kingdom of Heaven. As we were not redeem'd by corruptible things, ſuch as Gold, Silver, or precious Stones; ſo neither is our purchas'd Inheritance of ſo trifling and inconſiderable a value. The Liberty of the Sons of God is an Eternal Emancipation from Sin and Miſery, from the Sollicitations of our Senſes, the Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities of Satan, and from all the Diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages and Incumbrances of this mortal State. Have you ſeen the Cedars or the Fir-Trees, which from a little Seed riſe ſo high, and ſpread their Branches ſo wide? Juſt ſo will it fare with Man in the State of Regeneration; infinitely beyond his preſent Self will his Perfections be. Here the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible Body preſſeth down the Soul, and the Earthly Tabernacle weighs down the Mind, which otherwiſe would muſe of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things. But there will our Spirits, to their endleſs Joy and Comfort, find their Garments lighter; this unweildy Clog of Fleſh and Blood being made fit to ſerve them in their briskeſt Motions, and even to vye with the ſwifteſt Seraph that flies in the Regions of Light and Glory. Here though we ſometimes travel with Vigour and Alacrity in the way that leads to <hi>Sion</hi>;
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:52696:80"/>
yet in an inſtant ſuch Fogs and Vapours riſe from our terrene and ſenſual Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as caſt a cold Damp over all our Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and make us heartleſs and unactive as the Earth we tread on. But there we ſhall be all Life, and Spirit, and Wing, entirely freed from the Viciſſitudes of Mortality, and bath our active and ſprightly Plumes in the Silver Streams of Eternal Joy and Delight. Here Satan ſometimes mixeth himſelf among the Children of God, and many enter into the Choirs of the Saints, who know not how to chant their raviſhing Melody, the Songs of <hi>Sion.</hi> But in the Bleſſed Conſort above, every Soul will be harmonious, and skilfully contribute its part to the full Muſick of Heaven.

If theſe Corruptible Crowns, the fading momentary Honours of this Life; if (I ſay) the tranſient Favour of a Prince, and the vain, uncertain <hi>Plaudite</hi>'s and <hi>Hoſanna</hi>'s of the Crowd cannot be juſtly atchiev'd with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Toll and Labour; then ſurely we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not expect that theſe immortal Honours, the Approbation of God himſelf, the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe of his Holy Angels, and the Crown of Immortality, can be obtain'd at a chea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Rate.

               <p>Laſtly, I come to repreſent to you, the Reaſonableneſs of the Exhortation contain'd in the Text, from the Conſideration of the exceeding Brevity or Shortneſs of the Time we are allow'd to work in. Man is like a thing of nought, ſays the Pſalmiſt, his time paſſeth away like a Shadow, that neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſappears when the Sun leaves our Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizon, and may alſo fall ſhort of that Period by the Interpoſition of a Cloud. He car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries within himſelf the Cauſes of a neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and ſpeedy Diſſolution, and is alſo liable to ten thouſand Accidents without, that may haſten his Ruin. Nay, though by the good Providence of God he happily eſcapes
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:52696:82"/>
all theſe, and arrives to his utmoſt Period, that natural Term, which is ſet him by the Temperament of the Firſt Qualities; yet what an airy, fleting, and fantaſtick Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance is he? Our Life is but a Vapour, ſays St. <hi>James,</hi> which appears and dances up and down a few Minutes over the places that gave it Birth, and then vaniſheth, and ſinks back into its primitive Night and Darkneſs. The Day wears away apace, our Sun haſtens to go down, the Shadows every Moment encreaſe, and the Hours of Darkneſs come on, that long Night of Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and Solitude, wherein no Man can work. <hi>It is appointed for all men once to die,</hi> ſays the <note n="*" place="margin">Heb. 9.27.</note> Apoſtle, and then for ever to ceaſe from labouring and improving their State; for immediately follows Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which conſigns them either with <hi>Lazarus</hi> to the Refreſhments and Conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Boſom, or to the diſmal Dwellings of <hi>Dives</hi> in everlaſting Burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</p>

                  <hi>Plato</hi> indeed, and from him the <hi>Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts</hi> at this day, talk much of an interme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate State, where Satisfaction may be made for ſome Miſcarriages of our Lives here. But in all the Word of God, there is not ſo much as one place that countenanceth this Opinion. 'Tis not the Doctrine of God,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:52696:83"/>
but the Invention of Men; the weak and beggarly Element of this World, not the Revelation of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt: He only commands us to be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore prepar'd continually for our Laſt Hour, becauſe we then enter upon a ſtate eternal and immutable: that private particular Sentence which paſſeth upon the Soul at her Departure from the Body, being to be openly renew'd and confirm'd upon the whole Man at the General Day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. How ought then this Conſideration to alarm all the dormant Powers and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of our Souls, and to wind them up to the higheſt pitch of Action in this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentous Affair? How careful, I ſay, ſhould we be by a prudent Management and Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry of theſe fleting Moments, to ſecure to our ſelves a happy Portion in the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Eternity? If we miſpend theſe Days of Probation, you ſee there remain no more. If we neglect theſe preſent Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities, we are loſt for ever. And what a diſmal Reflection (think ye) will this be in the other World, when we ſhall remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that Mercy was frequently offer'd us, and that we as frequently rejected it? and that for the little imperfect Services of a few Days, our Maker graciouſly offer'd to place a Crown of Eternal Glory upon our Heads?

Alas! This is the chief Ingredient of that bitter Cup which afflicts and torments the Damn'd for ever and ever. This that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Thought, which raiſeth the Storms and Tempeſts in the Kingdom of Darkneſs below. Once they might have been ſav'd; once they had their Day, and they refus'd the Light when it ſhin'd. Their God was gracious and merciful to them, but they were cruel to themſelves. He offer'd them Mercy, but they would never accept it. He call'd them to Life, but they obſtinate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly choſe Death. No Tortures ſo exquiſite, as ſuch Reflections.

               <p>This (I ſay) is the deplorable and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done Condition of the Apoſtate Angels.

But Man, tho' a Being of a much lower Claſs, and an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate too, finds Favour and Mercy at the hands of his God. He vouchſafes him the liberty of Second Thoughts, and if we will but be obedient and hearken, promiſeth an entire Renovation of his Corrupted Nature by the abundant and powerful Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of his moſt Holy Spirit. Nay, ſo deſirous is he of this happy Change, that he long proſtitutes his Patience (as I ſhall inſtantly ſhew more at large) to Mens wanton Humours in Expectation of it, is contented to lay aſide his amazing Glories, and ſeems to diveſt and ſtrip himſelf of all his Attributes, ſave that of Mercy. His All-ſeeing Eye graciouſly overlooks our manifold Sins and Wickedneſſes, and, as tho' he ſaw them not, continues to ſhine upon us with its reviving Brightneſs. His Juſtice gives way to his Forbearance and
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:52696:86"/>
Long-ſuffering; and when it takes place, 'tis ſo temper'd and qualify'd, that in the midſt of Judgment he always remembers Mercy. Mercy is his Favourite, his dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Excellence, that lovely and amiable Attribute which is over all his Works, and in which, we are ſure, his Soul takes moſt Delight and Complacency.</p>
               <p>'Twas by this Name he, in the Preſence and Aſſembly of his invincible Holy Ones upon Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> moſt ſolemnly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim'd himſelf to his Servant <hi>Moſes: The Lord,</hi>

<pb n="163" facs="tcp:52696:86"/>
what compaſſionate Strains are theſe? 'Tis as if he had ſaid, Since there is no Being ſo great as my ſelf, by my ſelf I have ſworn, that as ſure as I am God, that eternal and faithful Being, with whom is no Variable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or Shadow of Turning, I deſire not the Death of any Sinner; but had rather, ten thouſand times over, that you would all, from the leaſt to the greateſt, hear my Voice in this Accepted Time, this day of Salvation, and repent, and be ſav'd. For now do I freely offer you my Grace, which I moſt paſſionately beſeech and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat you to accept, and to return, and live. Turn ye then, turn ye unto me, for why will ye die? Why will ye weary me out with your continued Provocations? Why will ye conſtrain me, by your unworthy and moſt wretched Abuſes of my Grace, your inſufferable Grievings of my Spirit, at length to depart from you, and to leave you to die in your Sins? Is Eternal Death ſo deſirable a thing? Is Heaven and my Glory ſo deſpicable and vile? Why then, let me ask you again, ſince you have my free Grace to enable you to Return, nay, ſince 'tis far eaſier for you to be ſaved than to be dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, why, why, will ye die, O houſe of <hi>Iſrael?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus does our Heavenly Father, by the moſt ſolemn Proteſtations demonſtrate his
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:52696:87"/>
Everlaſting Love and Kindneſs to Mankind. And how exactly do all his Diſpenſations correſpond with theſe his gracious Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations? With what Patience (I ſay) and Forbearance, does he deal even with the greateſt of Sinners? How affectionately in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat them to fly into the Harbour, and to ſecure themſelves, by a timely Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, from the Wrath which is to come? Such various Ways and Methods does he contrive to bring them to Repentance, ſo earneſtly beg and ſollicite them to accept in time the Terms of Salvation, that one would think 'twas his own, not their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, that Men ſhould be ſav'd. He al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, like a generous Enemy, declares Sinners his juſt Anger and Diſpleaſure, and excites them before it be too late, to prepare to Meet him, and with Weapons, which will moſt certainly prevail, <hi>viz.</hi> Prayers and Tears, to diſarm his Juſtice.</p>
               <p>Thus when within the ſmall compaſs of about two thouſand years his gracious and marvellous Works of Creation and Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence were ſo far from being, prais'd and had in Honour, that all Fleſh had degenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from this great End of its Creation, and moſt ſhamefully corrupted its way up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Earth; tho' he was griev'd (to ſpeak after the manner of Men) at the very
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:52696:87"/>
Heart, and it repented him that he had made Man, yet he could not immediately withdraw his Hand, and let him fall into Ruine, but mercifully prolong'd the day of Vengeance and gave his ſinful Creatures time and ſpace for Repentance. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd indeed, that the Spirits, which he had made, ſhould not Eternally remain in their Bodies, as Slaves and Vaſſals to thoſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of Unrighteouſneſs, but that if Men repented not, he would open the Windows of Heaven and break up the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of the great Deep, and bring in a Flood upon them, that ſhould ſweep them all away. But, before he can do this, <hi>Noah,</hi> a Preacher of Righteouſneſs, muſt daily aſſure them of their Danger, and he waits their Repentance a hundred and twenty Years.</p>
               <p>Thus too, tho' the Sins of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah</hi> were very grievous, and cryed loud, and the Cry of them aſcended up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Ears of the Lord of Sabbaoth, yet could not they prevail with him to let looſe his Thunder to overwhelm them with a ſwift and deſerv'd Deſtruction; but on the contrary (to prevent, if poſſible, their Ruine) he, by his good Providence, ſo order'd and diſpos'd things, that <hi>Lot,</hi> a holy and pious Perſon, living amongſt
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:52696:88"/>
them, ſhould firſt lay before them their prodigious Impieties, and warn them to prevent the heavy Judgments due to them, by a ſpeedy Repentance. And, when (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all this) they ſinned yet more, and forc'd his Holy Spirit to forſake them utterly, by their intolerable Forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations; yet would not his Goodneſs then give him leave to execute upon them the Fierceneſs of his Indignation; but ſtill ſtay'd his hand, and engag'd him to be gracious. As though 'twas poſſible for him to be deceiv'd, it induc'd him to make a further Enquiry; to go down, and ſee, whether they had indeed done altogether according to the Cry of it, which was come unto him. Nay, tho' their Sins and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations were ſo many and ſo great, yet ſo much greater was his Mercy; ſo unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling was he that they ſhould periſh, that he promis'd the interceeding Patriarch, that, if he cou'd find but ten Righteous Perſons amongſt them, he would ſave them all.</p>
               <p>But (not to multiply Inſtances, which are numberleſs) the livelieſt and moſt breathing Image of the Divine Mercy and Pity, the moſt glorious and raviſhing Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plays of his unbounded Compaſſions ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in the wonderful Contrivance of our Reſtitution, the myſterious and Coſtly Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:52696:88"/>
of Lapſed Man. This is an Inſtance of Love ſo aſtoniſhing and unfathomable, as will afford new matter through all the Ages of Eternity, for the Contemplation and Praiſes of the Saints and Angels in Heaven. Since 'tis a Province too great for any Created Being, the Son of God himſelf, before whoſe inſupportable Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries the Seraphims veil their faces, graciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſcends from the Celeſtial Paradiſe into the Wilderneſs of this World to ſeek his ſtraying Creatures, to reſtore the loſt ſheep of the Houſe of <hi>Iſrael</hi>; and with his own Voice to call them back to himſelf, the great Shepherd and Biſhop of their Souls. He comes in his Father's Name to proclaim Pardon and Forgiveneſs to all, that return to him; to demonſtrate his infinite Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs and Compaſſion for every Soul of the Sons of <hi>Adam</hi>; that (notwithſtanding all their Sins) he would not have any of them periſh, not the greateſt, not the old<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, not the moſt preſumptuous of Sinners, but that all ſhould come to the Knowledge of the Truth, and be ſav'd. This is his Buſineſs, This his Errand, This the great End and Deſign of his Coming; which having finiſh'd in all the Parts he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took, and to confirm our Faith, ſeal'd his Letters of Invitation with his own Blood;
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:52696:89"/>
and being now to return to the Father, he (to the Everlaſting Comfort and Joy of Repenting Sinners) commands his Apoſtles to go forth and carry them into all Parts of the World. <hi>Go</hi>

                  <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, that <hi>God was in Chriſt, reconciling the world unto himſelf,</hi> not imputing to them their treſpaſſes and ſins. The whole Tenour and Deſign (you ſee) of the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical Diſpenſation is to bring Sinners to their Saviour, to call them off from all their vain Confidences, to believe and truſt only in the Son of God; to beſeech them to come to Chriſt, that they may be refreſh'd and find Reſt unto their Souls. And ſo I am brought to the Second Thing obſervable in the Text, <hi>viz.</hi> the Perſon to whom the Invitation is made; To Me: that is to our only Saviour and Redeemer, the Lord Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We are not then to unfold our Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities, or to preſent our Supplications and Prayers to Saints or Martyrs, to Patriarchs, Prophets, or Apoſtles, no not to the Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Virgin Mother her ſelf.

               <p>Now theſe (I ſay) are Rants and Exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes indeed.

                  <hi>Iſaiah: Abraham</hi> is ignorant of us, and <hi>Iſrael</hi> knows us not. For certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly if <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Iſrael</hi> were ignorant and know nothing of the Affairs of that very People which deſcended from their own Loins, then we have all the Reaſon in the World to conclude, that the Saints in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:52696:90"/>
have no conſtant Knowledge of us, and of our Affairs, who are perfect Strangers to their Blood and Families.</p>
               <p>Our Adverſaries (I know) will be here ready to Object, That <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Iſrael</hi> were rightly ſaid by the Prophet to be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, and to know nothing in his Time of the Affairs of Mankind, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that then indeed 'twas but in vain, and to no purpoſe, to pray to them, becauſe before the Reſurrection of our Lord the Patriarchs were not admitted into Heaven, but lay only in <hi>Limbo,</hi> the Retir'd and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Caverns of the Earth, where they were utterly excluded from the Viſion of God and likewiſe from all Traffick and Commerce with Men. But that now the caſe is quite alter'd with them; that they are all tranſlated from thoſe Regions of Darkneſs, that State of Expectation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> thoſe Tabernacles of Hope, into the inmoſt Court of Heaven, the Kingdom of their Father, the Land of Fruition, where their Underſtandings are ſo widen'd and enlarg'd that they have a particular, entire, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Knowledge of all things, that are done both in Heaven and Earth, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently of all the Circumſtances, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns, Occurrences, and Affairs of every Man's Life, ſo that now they are become the proper Objects of our Devotion; being
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:52696:91"/>
both privy to all our Neceſſities, and alſo as Fellow-Members of the ſame Myſtical Body, moſt willing and ready to here and aſſiſt us. But I anſwer,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That this Opinion of <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Iſrael</hi>'s being in <hi>Limbo</hi> only, and not in Heaven it ſelf before the Reſurrection of our Lord, is groundleſs and unwarrantable. <hi>Elias,</hi> we are ſure, was tranſlated into Heaven, and we know likewiſe, that <hi>Moſes</hi> came down with him from that place to commune with our Lord upon the Mount. But if theſe his Sons were thought wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, before the Reſurrection of our Lord, to be admitted into thoſe bliſsful Manſions; why <hi>Abraham,</hi> the Father of the Faithful, and the Peculiar Friend of God; Why <hi>Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and the other Patriarchs and Prophets, who were all Heirs of the ſame moſt holy Faith, ſhould be excluded, I know not.</p>
               <p>But ſuppoſing this Opinion was really as true as they would have it; and that we could not deny, (what you ſee, we have all the Reaſon in the World to deny,) but that the Saints before the Reſurrection of our Lord lay only in <hi>Limbo,</hi> but are now in Heaven: yet that being there, they have a particular, entire, and perfect Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of all things that are done in Heaven and Earth, and conſequently of all the
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:52696:91"/>
Circumſtances, Concerns, Occurrences, and Affairs of every Man's Life, and ſo are become the Objects of our Devotion, is, I anſwer in the</p>
               <p n="2">2. Place a moſt unphiloſophical, falſe, and impious Aſſertion that has no Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Scripture, Reaſon, or Antiquity.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It has no Foundation in Scripture. Now to pray after any other manner than what Chriſt himſelf hath taught us, is not only Ignorance, but Sin, ſays <note n="*" place="margin">De Orat. Domin. <hi>pag. 139.</hi> Ed. Oxon.</note> St. <hi>Cyprian.</hi> But what one place is there (I ask) in all his Scriptures, that demands this of us? which of all his Apoſtles, Evangeliſts, or Prophets, doth allow that any of the Saints departed ſhould be invok'd by us? <hi>Bannes,</hi> a Learned Dominican, ingenuouſly confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, that he knows not of any. His Words are as expreſs and full as can be: <hi>Orationes ad Sanctos faciendas nequè etiàm expreſsè nequè involute Scripturae docent, i. e.</hi> that 'tis our Duty to Pray to the Saints the Scriptures do neither explicitely nor im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitely inform us. And thoſe of his own Profeſſion have never yet been able to ſhew that he is in an Errour.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This Aſſertion has no Foundation in Reaſon. For if the Saints in Heaven have a particular, entire, and perfect Knowledge of all things that are done in Heaven and
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:52696:92"/>
Earth, and conſequently of all the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, Concerns, Occurrences, and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of every Man's Life, and ſo are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the Objects of our Devotion, then this Knowledge of theirs is owing either</p>
               <p n="1">1. To their own Ubiquitary Preſence, by vertue of which they ſee and hear all our Words and Actions, as ſome of our Adverſaries affirm. Or,</p>
               <p n="2">2. As others, with the like Boldneſs, To their Perſpicacity and Clear-ſightedneſs, whereby they are able to diſcern our very Thoughts and Intentions. Or,</p>
               <p n="3">3. To the conſtant and faithful Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of daily-aſcending Saints and Angels; as a Third more modeſtly. Or,</p>
               <p n="4">4. As moſt, To the Viſion of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Eſſence, which they call <hi>Speculum Trinitatis.</hi> But all theſe ways are ridiculous and abſurd, and ſome of them impious. For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Saints in Heaven have not a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, entire, and perfect Knowledge of all things that are done in Heaven and Earth, and conſequently of all the Circumſtances, Concerns, Occurrences, and Affairs of every Man's Life, and ſo are become the Objects of our Devotion, becauſe they are every where preſent, and ſo ſee and hear all our Words and Actions. Heaven indeed is God's Throne, and the Earth is his Foot-ſtool. The
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:52696:92"/>
Heaven of Heavens cannot contain him; but he fills all Places both in Heaven and Earth, and the imaginary Space too beyond the Limits of Both, he is a God near at hand to us all; to thoſe that abide in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent, and that remain in the broad Sea, and alſo that live afar off in the Ends of all the Earth. In a word, tho' he cannot be circumſcrib'd or included in any Place, yet by his Immenſity he is ſo every where pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, as not to be excluded out of any; ſo that we may all of us, at one and the ſame time, pour out our Prayers before him with full Aſſurance of being heard. But now 'tis quite otherwiſe with all Created Beings. Creation neceſſarily implies Limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; ſo that 'tis as great a Contradiction to ſay, That the Eſſence or Virtue of a Created Being can be Boundleſs or Infinite, as that a Self-Exiſtent, Independent Being can be Finite. Every Abſtracted Spirit therefore ſince Created, tho' rais'd to the utmoſt degree of its Perfection, is but Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite; and conſequently (as that great Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch of the <hi>Roman</hi> Schools, <note n="*" place="margin">Sum. Part. prim. Quaeſt. <hi>52.</hi> Art. <hi>2.</hi>

<pb n="176" facs="tcp:52696:93"/>
ſelf to all places, that 'tis always neceſſarily and unavoidably but in one. <hi>Non eſt ubique, nec in pluribus locis, ſed in uno loco tantùm,</hi> as he ſpeaks again in the ſame Paragraph. Great then only is the Lord, and greatly to be praiſed, becauſe there is no End of his Greatneſs.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Saints in Heaven have not a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, entire, and perfect Knowledge of all things that are done in Heaven and Earth, and conſequently of all the Circumſtances, Concerns, Occurrences, and Affairs of every Man's Life, and ſo are become the Objects of our Devotion, from their Perſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacity or Clear-ſightedneſs, whereby they are able to diſcern our very Thought and Intentions. This is plain from the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment immediately foregoing: For ſince, according to the Laws of Creation, the Saints are all limited and circumſcrib'd in their Eſſences and Perfections, it muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily be granted, that they are likewiſe limited and circumſcrib'd in their Science or Knowledge; it being impoſſible for any Being but ſuch as is Immenſe and fills all Places, to know the different Concerns of all the ſeveral Beings reſiding and acting in thoſe different Places. God then alone (ſince it appears, that he only is Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent) muſt be acknowledg'd to be

                  </gap>, the Searcher of the Hearts. In him indeed do our Souls and Bodies live, move, and have their Beings. He under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands our Conſtitution, knows whereof we are made, the Compoſition (as I may ſo ſay) of our very Eſſences, and therefore diſcerns all the Motions and Operations of our Souls. In ſhort, 'Tis his Prerogative alone to be about our Paths, and about our Beds, in our Hearts, and in our Spirits, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to ſpy out all our Ways. Whence it likewiſe appears in the</p>
               <p n="3">3. Place, That the Saints in Heaven have not a particular, entire, and perfect Knowledge of all things that are done in Heaven and Earth, and conſequently of all the Circumſtances, Concerns, Occurrences, and Affairs of every Man's Life, and ſo are become the Objects of our Devotion; from the conſtant and faithful Relations of daily aſcending Saints and Angels; from the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formations and kind Intercourſes of Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian Angels, and the narrations of ſuch hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Spirits, as leaving their Earthly Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle daily aſcend thither; becauſe 'tis evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent (you ſee) that there are many things here amongſt us, which theſe Saints and Angels can never underſtand, many Deſigns and Contrivances, many Wiſhes and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, many Vows and Prayers, that are

lodg'd only in the Heart, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly are known only unto God. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Saints in Heaven have not a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, entire, and perfect Knowledge of all things, that are done in Heaven and Earth, and conſequently of all the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, Concerns, Occurrences, and Affairs of every Man's Life, and ſo are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the Objects of our Devotion, from the viſion of the Divine Eſſence, which they call <hi>Speculum Trinitatis.</hi> Now 'tis a great Queſtion amongſt Learn'd Men, Whether the Bleſſed Spirits above are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed capable of ſeeing the Divine Eſſence, and many of no ordinary note eſpouſe the Negative, thinking it as impoſſible for a Created, Finite Being, to behold the Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of an Uncreated, Infinite Being, as 'tis for a Bird of Night to gaze ſteddily upon the Sun. Which Opinion (if true) entirely deſtroys this <hi>Speculum Trinitatis,</hi> and daſhes it with its Conſequences, all to pieces upon the Ground. But, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, I hitherto ſee nothing that can induce me to embrace it, The Affirmative ſeems moſt conſonant both to Scripture and Reaſon.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Moſes</hi> humbly deſir'd, that God would vouchſafe to ſhew him his Glory,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:52696:94"/>
or to imprint upon his Mind a clear, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct Idea of his Divine Eſſence, he was anſwer'd, That he could nor have his wiſh now, whilſt he lay under the Diſadvantages of Mortality, becauſe he was a God dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in ſuch Light, as no Mortal Eye could approach; but that he ſhould ſo ſee him hereafter, when theſe Impediments ſhould be remov'd, and he happily inveſted with the ſtronger Privileges of Immortality. Thou can'ſt not ſee my Face, ſays God,<note place="margin">Exod. 33.20.</note> for there ſhall no man ſee me, and live. For theſe words certainly imply, That tho' he could not now, by reaſon of the thick Veil of his fleſh; yet that he ſhould ſee his Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence hereafter, both when his Earthly Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle ſhould be diſſolv'd and laid aſide<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and alſo, when he ſhould receive it again all clarify'd and ſpiritualiz'd.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf undoubtedly underſtood them thus: for had he thought otherwiſe, and that he was never to be admitted to the Intuition of his Maker's Glory, the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, clear, and real Viſion of his Divine Eſſence; but that he was for ever to reſt in Symbals and Figures; in reflected Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and ſecondary Manifeſtations, (which was to find his Ultimate Happineſs in ſome thing really diſtinct from his God) his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout, affectionate Soul, which ſo ardently
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:52696:95"/>
breath'd after the moſt intimate Fruition even of the Living God, would never have been ſatisfy'd with this uncomfortable An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, but we had queſtionleſs heard of the ſad Complaints, the bitter Bemoanings, and doleful Accents of his diſconſolate Spirit, who, when the natural Byaſs of her Deſires mov'd neceſſarily towards God, trembling continually, like the amorous Needle, for the Embraces of that moſt Lovely and Amiable Object; was yet for ever excluded from his Beatifick Preſence, the Contemplation and Fruition of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriour Beauties of her Belov'd.</p>
               <p>And indeed we all ſo naturally deſire to ſee this Firſt Cauſe, this Parent of Nature, and the Author of all our Beings, that tho' we were ſurrounded with all the Sweets of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe, all the other moſt exquiſite Delights and Entertainments that Heaven can afford; yet, without Him they would but fade<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and wither, and dwindle into nothing, and our reſtleſs, diſſatisfy'd Spirits would ſtill, in the midſt of them all, be impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently crying out, Ah! Where, Where is our God? For as He is the Firſt of Beings, ſo is He the Laſt of Ends: <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, ſays <hi>Plato</hi> rightly, that proper and principal End of Rational Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, the Viſion of whom alone can ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:52696:95"/>
the aſpiring Soul, and in the Circle of whoſe Embraces only the immoratal Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit finds Reſt, and Peace, and Joy for Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more.</p>
               <p>See him then we ſhall in the other World: See the Soveraign Fair openly and clearly, really, and as He is. Now we hear of him by the Ear; but then, ſhall our Eye with Joy and Triumph ſee him. Now we ſee through a glaſs, darkly; but then Face to Face. Now we know only in part but then ſhall we know, even as we our ſelves alſo are known.</p>
               <p>This Expreſſion (I readily acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge) is not to be underſtood according to the Strictneſs of the Letter. As we are known, is a Note of Similitude only, not of Equality; for the Sun may as well be included in a Spark of Fire, as God be comprehended by our Finite Faculties. Know him then we ſhall, not ſo as to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend him, but ſo as to be raviſh'd and for ever tranſported with his Eſſential Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections. The Light of a Candle as truly ſhines as the Light of the Sun, tho' not with equal Extent and Splendour; ſo ſhall our Knowledge be truly like His, reaching even His Divine Eſſence, tho' not Equal to His in comprehending it, as He does ours.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="182" facs="tcp:52696:96"/>Thus far then are we and our Adverſaries agreed. The Saints in Heaven do really view and contemplate the Divine Eſſence. But now to ſay, that they behold in it all things that are done in Heaven and Earth, and conſequently all the Circumſtances, Concerns, Occurrences, and Affairs of every Man's Life, and ſo are become the Objects of our Devotion, is moſt abſurd and ridiculous. If you let a Veſſel down into the Sea, 'twill indeed be fill'd to the utmoſt of its Capacity; but then, you know, it muſt needs overflow, becauſe 'tis impoſſible it ſhould receive into its Boſom the vaſt Congeries of that inexhauſtible Abyſs. So admit the Saints into the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of their Maker, where they may clearly and diſtinctly behold his Divine Eſſence: their Finite Underſtandings may indeed by his voluntary Revelations be fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with all that Knowledge they are capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of receiving; but then 'tis neceſſary they likewiſe overflow, becauſe, 'tis abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely impoſſible they ſhould be widen'd and enlarg'd to the infinite and boundleſs Comprehenſions of Omniſcience.</p>
               <p>This beſides the Reaſon of the thing, (which aſſures us, that 'tis abſolute im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible any Being ſhould have the Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes of the Divine Nature, which has not
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:52696:96"/>
the Divine Nature it ſelf) is plain from the Inſtance of the Angels. Theſe Bleſſed Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits were before the Incarnation of our Lord admitted into their Father's Houſe, the Manſions of Glory, the Royal City of the Heavenly King. The time of their Proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was over and gone, and they all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alterably confirm'd in a ſtate of Happineſs and Glory. Their Buſineſs, and Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was to contemplate the Unfolded Beauties of the Divine Countenance, and to ſing continually in the Preſence of the Lord, that Great is the Glory of their God. And yet how imperfect was the Knowledge, how improveable the Underſtandings even of theſe Intelligences? Notwithſtanding this clear Viſion of the Divine Eſſence, the Myſtery of Man's Redemption was ſo far hid from their Eyes that before the Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation of the Son of God in the Fleſh, they had only ſome general, dark, and obſcure Notices of it. And tho' now (as <note n="*" place="margin">Epheſ. 3.10.</note> St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us) the manifold Wiſdom of God is in a greater meaſure made known unto them by his Diſpenſations in the Church, yet even now are they ſo far from being able to comprehend it, that <note n="†" place="margin">1 Epiſt. 1.12.</note> St. <hi>Peter</hi> aſſures us they ſtill deſire to look farther into it. Theſe things, ſays he, the Angels deſire to look into. In ſhort, our

Lord has put this caſe beyond all doubt; for ſpeaking of the Day of Judgment: Of that Day and Hour, <note n="‖" place="margin">Matth. 24.36. &amp; Mat. 13.32.</note> ſays he, knoweth no Man, no, not the Angels of Heaven, nor the Son, but my Father only. For if the Son of God himſelf, as Man, tho' he is to be the Umpire of that Great Day; and the Holy Angels, who always behold the Face of their Father, and who with unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Alacrity and Joy will attend and wait upon him in this his glorious Expedition, was once and are ſtill ignorant in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, then certainly it can be nothing but Folly and Madneſs to imagine, that the Spirits of Juſt Men and Women (which, tho' never ſo perfect as ſuch, are, as they ſtand in Relation to their Bodies, to whom they have a natural Inclination, even in Heaven it ſelf, but in a State of Imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) ſhould ſo far excel, as to have an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire and perfect Knowledge of all things, that are done both in Heaven and Earth.</p>
               <p>Now then from what has been thus diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours'd, I preſume, 'tis Evident, that there is no Foundation in Reaſon to think, that the Saints (tho in Heaven) have a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, entire and perfect Knowledge of all things that are done in Heaven and Earth, and conſequently of all the Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Concerns, Occurrences, and Affairs of

               <p n="3">3. There is no Perſon, no Time, no Rank or Quality whatſoever, that is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted.

<pb n="196" facs="tcp:52696:103"/>
that he hath committed, and doth that which is lawful and right, he ſhall ſave his ſoul alive.</hi> Accordingly we find God, in the 1ſt of <hi>Iſa.</hi> calling to all Sinners in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, without any Diſtinction of Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, Ages, or Conditions, to come, and be reconcil'd to him. <hi>Waſh ye, make ye clean,</hi> ſays he, <hi>put away the evil of your do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings from before mine eyes, ceaſe to do evil, learn to do well</hi>; and then, tho' neither the Out-goings of the Morning, nor of the Evening, have prais'd me; but from the Height of your Youth to the Declenſions of Old Age, you have been taken, and led Captive by your Sins at their will, I will do them all away: <hi>Tho' they be as Scarlet, they ſhall be white like Snow; tho' they be red like Crimſon, they ſhall be as wool.</hi> And again, in the third of <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> he with Infinite Tenderneſs and Affection courts his People to come to him, tho' they had moſt frequently revolted, and infinitely of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended his Divine Majeſty.

Thus ſolemnly and pathetically does he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare (as you ſaw more at large in my Firſt General Head) his Good-will towards them; that he deſires not the death of any of them all; but had rather they would every one of them, from the Leaſt to the Greateſt, turn from their evil ways, and Live.</p>
               <p>And yet we meet with ſome Perſons in the World, whoſe Ears are entirely ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped againſt this gracious and raviſhing Voice of the Heavenly Charmer. The Suggeſtions of Satan, or the Unhappineſs of an ill Conſtitution of Body, or the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warrantable Aſſertions of ſome ill-natur'd, ſurly and melancholy Pſeudo-Prophets, or poſſibly all theſe three together, have plung'd their tender Spirits in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foundeſt Depth of Amazement and Deſpair.

in Scripture ſometimes denoting no more, than an extream Difficulty. Thus our Lord expreſsly <note n="*" place="margin">Mark 10.</note> declares, that <hi>'tis eaſier for a camel to go through the Eye of a Nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle,</hi> (which is abſolutely impoſſible) <hi>than for a rich Man to enter into the Kingdom of God.</hi> Yet he means not by this Aſſertion utterly to exclude all Rich Men from the Hopes of Heaven; but only ſignifies to us, that 'tis a very hard and difficult matter for them that truſt in Riches, ſaying to Gold, Thou art our Hope, and to the fine Gold, Thou art our Confidence, ever to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take the ſeverer Diſcipline of the Goſpel here, and conſequently to be made Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of his Glory in the Kingdom of Heaven hereafter. <hi>How hard is it,</hi> ſays he to his aſtoniſh'd Diſciples, <hi>for them that truſt in Riches, to enter into the Kingdom of God</hi>? In like manner, (ſay theſe Learned Men) when he poſitively aſſerts, that all Sins and Blaſphemies whatſoever ſhall be forgiven unto Men, but that the Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my againſt the Holy Ghoſt ſhall never be forgiven, he means not, that 'tis abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly impoſſible it ſhould ever be forgiven; but only, that it ſhall not be forgiven ſo eaſily, but more hardly, and with greater Difficulty, than any other Sin or Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my whatſoever, <hi>Non utiquè quod remitti non
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:52696:105"/>
poſſit,</hi> as the fore-cited Jeſuit; not that it cannot he forgiven at all; but becauſe they who commit it, <hi>nullam peccati ſui excuſationem habent,</hi> are utterly deſtitute of all Apologies and Excuſes, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are more unpardonable than other Men.</p>
               <p>I confeſs, I can determine nothing in this matter, whether this Sin be irremiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible or not; I can only anſwer with the humble Prophet, <hi>Lord, thou knoweſt.</hi> God's gracious dealing indeed with <hi>David</hi> after his Adultery and Murther, with <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> after his Denial of his Maſter, with <hi>Paul</hi> after his perſecuting the Church, and with a thouſand other Sinners of the ſame Magnitude, obligeth me to believe, that there is no Sin or Blaſphemy whatſoever which is irremiſſible in reſpect of God; and that therefore if the Sin againſt the Holy Ghoſt be indeed irremiſſible, 'tis on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly becauſe it utterly excludes thoſe who commit it, from Repentance.</p>
               <p>But tho I dare not be poſitive as to the Conſequences of this Sin; yet (what is a greater matter of Comfort to deſpairing Souls) I may venture to affirm, that, as to the Nature of it, 'tis ſuch as cannot be committed by any Chriſtian. If you ask me what 'tis, I briefly anſwer, That 'tis a
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:52696:105"/>
Total Apoſtaſie, and Final Falling away from Chriſt and his Goſpel. I ſay, a Total Apoſtaſie, and Final Falling away. And yet not every Total Apoſtaſie, and Final Falling away neither; For 'tis poſſible a poor, ignorant Soul may be ſo decluded, as to Apoſtatize from Chriſtianity to Mahometiſm, or ſome other Impoſture, and yet ſtill believe Chriſt to have been a very good Man. But this is ſuch a To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Apoſtaſie, ſuch a Final Falling away from Chriſt and his Goſpel, as is attended with the greateſt Virulency, Rancour, Spight and Malice againſt both as can be imagin'd. When a Man not only utterly renounceth the known Truth, but alſo doth hate and abhor Chriſt and his Word; doth revile and ſpit upon him; doth with the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees</hi> crucifie and mock him; and is ſo far from acknowledging him to be the Son of God, or indeed ſo much as a good Man, who did all his Miracles by the Power and Aſſiſtance of the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, that he moſt maliciouſly and deſpite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, after full Conviction of his Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the contrary, pronounceth him the greateſt of Cheats, a moſt grand Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtor, the Eldeſt Son of the Devil, who acted only by Commiſſion from <hi>Beelzebub,</hi> the Prince of the Devils.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="202" facs="tcp:52696:106"/>This I take to be plain from our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our's own Words, when he mention'd this Sin. <hi>There was brought unto him,</hi> ſays the Evangeliſt, <hi>one poſſeſs'd with a Devil, blind and dumb</hi>:<note place="margin">Matt. 12. compar'd with Mark 3.</note>

'Twas his Meat and Drink, when he liv'd amongſt us to proclaim Liberty to the Captives; to looſen thoſe, whom Sin and Satan has bound; to bind up the Broken-hearted; to give Medicines to heal their Sickneſſes, and to preach the acceptable Year of the Lord. And tho' now he is gone to Heaven; yet he has not left thee comfortleſs. He is abſtracted from thee as to his bodily Preſence; but, his Divine Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and Grace ſtill attend and wait upon thee. Not all the Glories of Heaven, the Allelujahs of the Angels, and the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant Songs of the Saints, can make him forget thee; but the ſame Tenderneſs of Spirit, the ſame Mercy and Loving-kindneſs which he had upon Earth he now in the mid'ſt of all his Glories, ſtill retains for thee in Heaven. We have not ſuch an High-Prieſt, ſays the Apoſtle, as cannot be touch'd with the feeling of our Infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; but who having been tempted himſelf, is able to ſuccour them that are tempted.

When a loſt Sheep of the houſe of Iſrael is found; when it is reſcu'd out of the Jaws of Death and of Hell; Snatch'd out of the Paw of that roaring Lion who continually goes about ſeeking whom he may devour, and ſafely brought back into the Fold of the great Shepherd the Lord Chriſt Jeſus; Theſe Bleſſed Spirits are no ſooner ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with it, but they take into their hands their inſtruments of Muſick, and in the higheſt Strains of Seraphick Joy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulate his Return.

Yet no ſooner does his Father ſpy him returning home, with a penitent Confeſſion in his Mouth; but (notwithſtanding his great Unworthineſs) his Bowels are mov'd towards him: yea, he becomes impatient, cannot expect his near Approach; but his Joy and Affection give him wings.

A Jubilation, I ſay in Heaven and Earth too: For ſee, thy Mother the Church, is highly concern'd for thee, ſhe mourns and laments thy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy State, and daily offers up Prayers and Tears for thy Recovery.

He made thee at firſt, when thou waſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; and when thou waſt loſt and worſe than nothing, He Redeem'd thee too with his own blood, and moſt ſolemnly ſwears he would not have thee periſh. Wilt thou not then believe Him, who hath done ſo many and great things for thee? Wilt thou not believe Him, who could even bleed and die for thee? If any Man of known Integrity had given thee his word thou wouldſt not Scruple to believe him: How then can'ſt thou thus affront thy God who cannot lye, by thy Infidelity; when he not only ſays, but alſo ſwears, he would have thee live? O! do not, do not thus evacuate all the gracious Methods the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Father is pleas'd to uſe for thy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery; Do not thus fooliſhly exclude thy ſelf from Happineſs, when God does not exclude thee.

him the Peculiar Favourite of Heaven and therefore receive him with the hearty and joyous Reiterations of Acclamations and Hoſanna's. Wherefore in a due ſenſe of theſe great bleſſings, he is not contented to offer only his own Sacrifice of Praiſe, but likewiſe in the beginning of this <hi>Pſalm</hi> excites all the people with their Doxologies and Allelujahs to aſſiſt and joyn with him in theſe his grateful acknowledgments. <hi>O give thanks unto the Lord,</hi> ſays he, <hi>for he is gracious becauſe his mercy endureth for ever. Let all the Tribes of Iſrael, let the Prieſts and Levites; yea let All them, that fear the Lord, confeſs, that he is gracious, and that his mercy endureth for ever.</hi> You need not recount the Wonders he ſhew'd for your Forefathers in the Land of <hi>Egypt</hi> nor recall to your Memories how after a Succeſſion of Mracles for forty years in the Wilderneſs, he at laſt with a mighty Hand and ſtretch'd-out Arm drove out the Nations before them, and gave them this pleaſant Land for an Inheritance; Look on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon me, and you will ſee a moſt lively Inſtance of his Mercy and Goodneſs. For when mine Enemies ſwarm'd about me like Bees, and as one Man, conſpir'd with all their Might and Cunning to throw me down from the Throne to which I was
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:52696:113"/>
advanc'd; when I was invaded by vaſt Multitudes from abroad, and undermin'd by the ſecret Treacheries and Machinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of more dangerous Adverſaries at home; even then, when there ſeem'd no poſſible way for my Eſcape, was the Lord my Helper, and is become my Strength, and my Song, and my mighty Salvation. So that the Stone which theſe unskilful Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers would have rejected, as unfit to be uſed, is, you ſee, become the head-ſtone in the Corner, whilſt (notwithſtanding all the Attempts of mine Enemies to the contrary) I ſit this day ſafely on my Fathers Seat. Now then, it ever, preſent your ſelves joyful before the Lord the King, and come with me into his Courts in the voice of Thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving; for This, of all others, is the Day which the Lord himſelf hath made; we will therefore rejoyce and be glad in it.</p>
            <p>Thus you have, in ſhort, the occaſion of theſe Words, which I ſhall no longer inſiſt upon, as they reſpect the circumſtances of <hi>David</hi>; but conſider them wholly, as they reflect Luſtre upon the Solemnization of this preſent Day. A Day, which, if any, may moſt properly be ſaid to be made by the Lord, ſince it bears the livelieſt Characters and Impreſſes of his Power and knowledge, of his Wiſdom and Goodneſs,
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:52696:113"/>
and of all thoſe other glorious Attributes whereby we are aſſur'd, that he governs the World. For trace the Hiſtories of ancient Times, turn over all Authors both Sacred and Prophane, and (the Day of our Spiritual Redemption excepted) pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce me a Day like This, ſo memorable in its Circumſtances, ſo glorious in its Iſſue, and ſo unparallel'd in its Conſummation. Of all thoſe Deliverances God in paſt Ages vouchſaf'd his Church, methinks none ever amounted to the Wonder of this Day, when I conſider;</p>
            <p n="1">1. The black and diſmal nature of the Deſign, which was this Day fram'd againſt us. And,</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Strangeneſs and Unexpectedneſs of our Deliverance from it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. I ſay, It will appear, that of all thoſe Deliverances God in paſt Ages vouchſaf'd his Church, none ever amounted to the Wonder of this Day; and conſequently, that this Day, of all others, may moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly be ſaid to be made by the Lord, if we conſider the black and diſmal nature of the Deſign, which was this Day fram'd againſt us. As the Heavens rejoyc'd and the Earth was glad to ſee the glory of the Lord in the uncorrupted Light of the Goſpel after a long Night of Ignorance and
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:52696:114"/>
Superſtition ariſe in Brightneſs upon us; ſo thoſe reſtleſs Spirits, who always bore Evil-will to our <hi>Zion,</hi> as though they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a ſecond Downfall, in their undiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned Habitations vented themſelves in nothing, but Lamentations, and Mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and Woe. They ſaw the unparallell'd Beauty of her Countenance, which, tho' long mask'd and clouded with the Veil of Widowhood, did now at length break forth in ſuch Splendour and Brightneſs, that the <hi>Gentiles</hi> were coming to her Light, and Kings to rejoyce in the Brightneſs of her Riſing. That therefore in this holy Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain there was no Den for ſuch Beaſts of Prey, but that they muſt either forego their beloved Dainties, and peaceably lie down in the Paſtures with the Lamb, or for their own Security betake themſelves to harder ſeeding in the barren Receſſes of the Wilderneſs. Wherefore, impatient both of Reſtraint and Exile, they incontinently breathed out our Deſtruction; and to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port and underprop their ſinking Intereſt, at ſundry Times, and in divers Manners, endeavour'd to overturn the Foundations of our Felicity; ſometimes, with the factious Son of <hi>Sheba,</hi> they blow'd the Trumpet of Rebellion, diſclaim'd their Right in <hi>David,</hi> and endeavoured by good
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:52696:114"/>
Words, and fair Speeches, to perſwade others alſo, that they likewiſe had no In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance in the King. Sometimes, on the contrary, by the terrible Aſſaults of Anathema's, Curſes, and Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, they laboured to ſcare and fright us into a Compliance. But when they found, that (notwithſtanding all their Craft and Subtlety) their Deſigns were ſtill defeated and unravell'd, and all their moſt cunningly contriv'd Enterpriſes dwindled into conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual Diſappointments; that their ravenous, woolfiſh Nature, tho' never ſo cloſe cover'd with Sheeps-cloathing, was always diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, and that none therefore dar'd to come in to their Standard, nor, tho' led on by the Infallible Hero himſelf, to enter the Field againſt the Lords Anointed; ſo that neither their Armado's from <hi>Spain,</hi> nor falſe Witneſſes from St. <hi>Omers,</hi> nor all thoſe dreadful Thunderings and Lightnings from <hi>Rome</hi> could prevail any thing at all; but that the Virgin, the Daughter of <hi>Zion,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpis'd them and laugh'd them to ſcorn, the Daughter of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſtill ſhook her head at them; as Men even encouraged by Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointments, and emboldned by Repulſes they ſtart anew, and rather than be for ever fruſtrated, are contented to deveſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves utterly of their Humanity, and to
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:52696:115"/>
embark into ſo barbarous, ſo ſavage a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, as will make the ears of all Poſterity to tingle. Many Waters cannot quench their burning Rage, neither can the Floods, how deep ſoever, drown their Fury; but they reſolve to tear in pieces the more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Prey, and one way or other to take their Paſtime in Rivers of Royal Blood. <hi>Fle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctere fi nequeunt Superos</hi> —Since Heaven and Earth, Angels and Men, are againſt them they deſcend into the Regions of Darkneſs and Obſcurity, as if they deſign'd to ask Counſel of the Powers of Darkneſs. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed whoever accurately contemplates the nature of this curſed Deſign, muſt needs ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge it to bear all the marks of a hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, diabolical Off-ſpring. For where, but in the diſmal Regions of everlaſting Malice and Cruelty, could be hatch'd ſo barbarous, ſo villainous a Conſpiracy? A Conſpiracy ſo black and deteſtable, ſo hideous in its Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, ſo fatal in its Conſequences, that 'tis hardly poſſible to imagine, that it could have been invented by Man, unleſs (what the <hi>Jews</hi> of old thought of their <hi>Daemoniacks</hi>) they had really been conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into the Nature and Subſtance of fierce, implacable, deſtructive <hi>Daemons.</hi> A Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy, which, if it had taken effect, would have utterly extinguiſh'd the Light of our <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and overſpread the Nation

A Conſpiracy, that would have involv'd us all in Blood, expoſed our Wives and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to the mercileſs Fury of our Enemies, and enſlav'd our Lives and Fortunes, Souls and Bodies, to the imperious and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mineering Lords of monopolizing <hi>Rome.</hi> Laſtly, A Conſpiracy it was whoſe teeming Womb was ready to bring forth the ghaſtly Iſſue of Blood and Fire, and pillars of ſmoak, which would either have rendered our beautiful Cities a Wilderneſs, or (which is worſe) an Habitation of Dragons, and made <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> a Deſolation. Alas!

<pb n="222" facs="tcp:52696:116"/>
our Land would have mourn'd for the Loſs of her Gracious Soveraign, our Cities of their wiſe and prudent Governours, our Countries of their vigilant and powerful Guardians (which alone would have ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred us the Wonder and Aſtoniſhment of Men and Angels) but (which is yet worſe, if any thing can be worſe) our pure and undefil'd Religion had alſo been loſt in the general Devaſtation. Thoſe inſatiable flames, which had devour'd her noble Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons, would likewiſe unmercifully have prey'd upon her drooping Vitals, till they had rariſy'd her Subſtance into a mere em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pty Shadow, and chang'd the Spirituality of her Worſhip into external, cumberſome, impertinent Ceremonies. In ſhort, What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the very Quinteſſence and Elixir of all villainy and Barbarity, of Superſtition and Idolatry, of Miſchief and Immanity could have impos'd upon us, muſt (unleſs the Almighty hand of God would have wrought a Miracle for their Reſcue and Deliverance) have been endured by our Poſterity throughout all Generations; ſo that this Church, (I ſay) which is now the Perfection of Beauty, and the Joy of the wholy Earth, had unhappily became the very Scorn and Deriſion of her Enemies, and their Song all the day long. But
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:52696:116"/>
(Bleſſed be God) our Soul is eſcap'd, as a Bird out of the Snare of the Fowler, the Snare is broken, the Deſign blaſted, the Plot unra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled, and we thereby moſt wonderfully delivered. Which brings me to my Second Particular, which is to ſhew, that it will likewiſe appear, that of all the Deliverances God in paſt Ages vouchſaf'd his Church, none ever amounted to the Wonder of this Day; and conſequently, that this Day, of all others, may moſt properly be ſaid to be made by the Lord, if we conſider the Strangeneſs and Unexpectedneſs of our Deliverance.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Many and glorious (I confeſs) have been the Deliverances which God in paſt Ages has vouchſaf'd his Church. He has often deſeated the Deſigns, infatuated the Counſels, and brought to nought the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices even of her moſt powerful Enemies, upholding her, when juſt ſinking by the hand of his Providence. But yet when I ſeriouſly reflect upon the diſmal Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of this Day's Deſign, how ſecret the Conſpiracy, how little Proſpect of a diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, and how ready the Execution, I am forc'd to acknowledge, that This, of all others, was the Lord's own doing and that 'tis altogether marvellous in our eyes. The Church of God indeed, in the <hi>Perſian</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:52696:117"/>
time, was deſtin'd to Ruine, and the black Decree ſeal'd with the King's own Signet. But then (you know) the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign was divulg'd, and the Day of Slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter deferr'd, ſo that the <hi>Jews</hi> had time to contrive means for their Preſervation, which accordingly we find they did, and turn'd the fatal Stroke upon the Heads of their Enemies. The Primitive Chriſtians likewiſe were often perſecuted and devoted to Death. But then they always, with the Prophet, foreſaw the Cloud that threatned them. The Emperours were Heathens, and ſo they could expect no better Uſage from them, and conſequently had warning to provide for themſelves. But now the caſe of our Church was quite different at this time. Her Security was her greateſt Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and her implicit Faith like to have ended in her Ruine. No Storm threatned from abroad, neither did any Cloud ſeem to gather over our Heads at home; but our Air was as ſerene and quiet, as free from Storms and Tempeſts, as the ſuperlunary Regions. The Mercy of our peaceful <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon,</hi> like the Sun-beams, did (as we ſhall ſee more at large by and by) ſo plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully diffuſe its kind Heat and Warmth to all ſorts of Men, that 'twas generally thought, he had melted the obdurate and
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:52696:117"/>
inflexible Hearts of his moſt virulent ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies into reciprocal Tenderneſs, Loyalty and Obedience. But, alas! the Event moſt truly Demonſtrated, that ſome of his beſt Subjects did not more frequently than juſtly tell him, that he was merciful even to a Fault; and kind, tho' it were to his own and the Kingdoms Danger. For when by theſe Means we were too eaſily perſwad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that our Enemies were reconcil'd to us, and become our Friends, ſo that we ſhould never ſee the Sons of the Giants return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to defie our <hi>Iſrael</hi> any more; and upon this account not only intoxicated our ſelves with preſent pleaſure, but entertain'd our thoughts likewiſe with the fair, delightful Proſpect of our future Felicity. Even then I ſay, when we thought our ſelves moſt ſecure, was the Enemy within our Walls, and the fatal Sword hanging over our Heads. The Snares of Death encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs'd us about, and our Souls were even hard at Deaths door. Strangers ſought after our Life, and we knew it not; yea they had caught us in their Nets; yet we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it not. There was indeed in the Kingdom a confus'd Notion, and obſcure Knowledge of ſome great thing, that was ſuddenly to be done; But then, as King <note n="*" place="margin">K. <hi>Jame</hi>'s Works, pag. 291.</note> 
               <hi>James</hi> aſſures us, 'twas only amongſt
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:52696:118"/>
the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> who likewiſe, for ſecrecies ſake, were not to be intruſted with the Particulars. But that the King and Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment were to be deſtroy'd, and that by the quick diſpatch of Gun-Powder. That the Enemy had ſo long ſate brooding upon this wicked Deſign, that the direful Off-ſpring was almoſt come to the birth: This was a thing of that nature, that no Proteſtant either fear'd, or ſo much as ſuſpected it. 'Twas lock'd up only in the Breaſts of the Conſpirators, who likewiſe, for the greater Concealment, had bound themſelves by an Oath of Secrecy; yea, under the ſeal of the Holy Sacrament, not to reveal it directly not indirectly to any without common Conſent. So that as to all exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Helps, our Caſe was as deſperate as poſſibly it could be, and we were even, like Sheep, bound ready for the Slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
            <p>Now then, did our own Strength or Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy bring Salvation to us, or our own Right-arm obtain us this Victory? Did the wiſdom of the Kings Counſellours, the Care of his Magiſtrates, the Subſidies of his Friends, the Fidelity of his Servants, or the Courage of his Soldiers work for him this Deliverance? No. We only ſtood, ſtill and ſaw the Salvation of God. Tho'
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:52696:118"/>
our hands were tied, God fought from Heaven for us, the Stars in their courſes fought againſt our Enemies. When the Harveſt was come, and they were juſt put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in the Sickle, he turn'd the Edge againſt themſelves, and cut them down in their Wickedneſs. He ſo infatuated their Counſels, and turn'd their deepeſt Policy like <hi>Achitophel</hi>'s into ſo great Fooliſhneſs, that when they might ſecurely have let in the Floods upon us, they turn'd the Stream directly againſt themſelves, ſo that the Waters went over their own Soul: Had they but gone on with the ſame Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacy they began, and not ſuffered the direful Project to wander beyond the Limits of their own Breaſts it had undoubtedly been crown'd with wiſh'd-for Succeſs. But as tho' the mighty Secret was too big to be long confin'd within ſo narrow a Compaſs, and, like a boiſterous Vapour ſhut up within a cloud, ſtrugled and was reſtleſs, 'till it tore its way through; of their own accord, when no Man either deſir'd, or compell'd them, they diſcloſed their own Wickedneſs; for by a Letter from one of them to the Lord <hi>Mounteagle</hi> (which yet was wrapt up in Terms as dark and aenigmatical as the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Hierogly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phicks (was the whole Matter moſt happily
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:52696:119"/>
diſcovered, and this horrid Deſign, which had long been contriving, and was now juſt brought to a head, in a moment moſt miraculouſly blaſted and confounded.</p>
            <p>Thus did He alone, who ſtilleth the raging of the Sea, curbing the Inſolence of its proud Waves only with Reins of ſand ſtem likewiſe the impetuous Torrent of our Enemies Fury, and ſet it its Bounds, which it could not paſs. Thus did He (I ſay) alone, who ſilenceth the raging Tempeſt, and commands the fighting Winds to leave off their Contentions, ſnatching the Mariner, when at his Wits end, from the devouring Jaws of the Deep, by the ſame Almighty <hi>Fiat</hi> ſtill the ſtorm that was about us; after all its Rage and Fury, gently wafting us to the Haven where we would be. Tho' we walk'd on ſtill in Darkneſs, 'till the Foundations of the earth were almoſt out of courſe, yet Hell was naked before Him, and Deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on had no Covering. Theſe black, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure Chambers of Death were as clear to him as the Light; and theſe gloomy Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of inextinguiſhable Malice as bright as the Noon-day. He therefore laught at their Attempts, derided their Counſels, and only therefore ſuffered them to bring us into the utmoſt Extremity, that when
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:52696:119"/>
he ſhould in due time deliver us, and we ſhould ſafely look back upon the Danger we had eſcap'd, we might not poſſibly communicate the Glory of our Preſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to any thing upon Earth, but be forc'd to attribute it wholly and entirely to His Goodneſs who alone giveth Salvation unto Kings, and delivereth his Servants from the hurtful Sword.</p>
            <p>And thus does it appear, both from the black and diſmal Nature of the Deſign, which was this Day fram'd againſt us, and alſo from the Strangeneſs and Unexpected<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of our Deliverance from that Deſign, that 'twas the Lord himſelf who was on our ſide when Men roſe up againſt us, and that we were delivered from theſe Dangerous Waters,<note place="margin">Zechar. 4.6.</note> as God ſpeaks to <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rubbabel,</hi> not by Might, nor by Power, but by his Spirit alone, which mov'd upon the Face of them, and that therefore upon all Accounts we may ſay, This eſpecially is the Day which the Lord hath made, and conſequently that we ought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce and to be glad in it. And ſo I come to the duty contain'd in my Text, <hi>viz.</hi> the Obligation incumbent upon us of rejoyc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and praiſing God for the Deliverances he vouchſafes us, imply'd in theſe latter Words: <hi>We will rejoyce and be glad in it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="230" facs="tcp:52696:120"/>Now I ſhall not encroach ſo much upon your Patience, as ſuperſlouſly to enlarge upon the Obligation of this Duty, which I rejoyce to find already acknowledg'd. But ſince your Chearfulneſs and Alacrity in its Performance has left me nothing elſe to do, than to encourage and applaud you in ſo good a Work, I ſhall only crave leave to propoſe two or three things to your conſiderations, whereby, I humbly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, you may moſt properly diſcharge it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Then. We cannot better expreſs our Joy and Gratitude to God for the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendent Mercy of this Day, than by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring our deteſtation and Abhorrence of that Doctrine, which as tho' its Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were laid upon the Traditions of Devils rather than of Men, countenanceth, nay, encourageth Men in ſuch black, Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian undertakings. Of that Doctrine, I ſay, which, under the venerable and ſacred Veil of the beſt Religion in the World, authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth its Profeſſors to perpetrate ſuch Villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, as the Pagans themſelves would bluſh to have committed. Many indeed are the Outrages and Barbarities committed by the Janizaries, and 'tis as ordinary for them amongſt the <hi>Turks,</hi> as 'twas of old for their Fellow-Praetorian bands amongſt the
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:52696:120"/>
               <hi>Romans,</hi> to deprive their Emperour of his Crown firſt, and then of his Life. But not to ſay, that theſe are only ſingle Perſons, or at fartheſt but particular Orders of Men; the things they commit will admit of Excuſe and Extenuation. They never pretend to do them upon the account of Religion, but purely for Politick Ends and the Good of the State. Their Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels fade and wither under the malignant Influence of the preſent Governour, whoſe Fortune (like a direful Comet) threatens Subverſion to the Empire, wherefore in the Tempeſt of their Souls they ſet up another in his place, whoſe happier Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, they hope, will repair the Ruines they have ſuffered and ſettle the Greatneſs and Grandeur of the ſtate upon a ſure, laſting, and immoveable Baſis. But now for a whole Sect of Men to be ſo biggotted and infatuated, as to be even oblig'd by the Principles of their Religion to dye their hands in the Blood of their Brethren; for Men of Reaſon, Learning, and Conſcience, to make it their Buſineſs to throw Kingdoms off their Hinges, and to tumble them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a ſtate of Anarchy and confuſion: For Chriſtians even in cold blood to ſtab the ſacred Perſons of Princes, and piouſly to Triumph in the Ruines of States and Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:52696:121"/>
This when done, (and This, you know, the <hi>Papiſts</hi> have often done) is enough to make the Sun once more to draw in his Beams, and the Angels to veil their Faces in Abhorrence and Deteſtation.</p>
            <p>I know there are ſome, who have the Confidence to tell us, that this is not the Doctrine of the Catholick Church, but the Preſumptions only of ſome private Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. But not to reply, that 'tis at leaſt the Tenet of the Jeſuits, and the concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Doctrine of all their Caſuiſts: Theſe objectors would do well to let us know, what one ſolemn Declaration that Church ever made againſt it. Alas! It was always ſo far from being diſcountenanc'd or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploded either by their Holy Father himſelf or any General Council, that for ſix hund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Years at leaſt it has been, as it were the diſcriminating Mark of that communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from all others. It hath been adopted into their Laws both Eccleſiaſtical and Civil; and highly approv'd and abetted by the Supreme Authority and Infallible Judgment of their Popes and Councils. Elſe how came it to paſs, that two of the Jeſuits, which were conſcious of this Plot, upon their Arrival were made, one the Pope's Penitentiary, the other a Confeſſor in St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s at <hi>Rome</hi>? that <hi>Garnet</hi>'s Name

Witneſs that Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate Prince, <hi>Henry</hi> III. of <hi>France,</hi> who within the Compaſs of this laſt Century, was ſtabb'd by one of his own Subjects, <hi>James Clement</hi> a Monk, only for favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Proteſtant Religion. Which, tho' an Execrable, Villainous, and Diaboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Act, was ſo far from being cenſur'd or condemn'd by <hi>Sixtus Quintus</hi> then Pope, that his Holineſs both approv'd, and alſo highly extoll'd it in a long Conſiſtory Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, calling it an excellent, glorious and memorable exploit, not atchiev'd without the ſpecial Providence and Appointment of the Great and Good God, and the Sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion and Aſſiſtance of his moſt Holy Spirit. Witneſs that grievous Maſſacre, which in our own memory, the <hi>Huguenots</hi> ſuffered in <hi>France,</hi> which, tho' equalling at leaſt the heat of any of the ten famous Perſecutions by the Heathen Emperors, was yet applauded by <hi>Innocent</hi> the Eleventh as a thing pleaſing unto God, a Sacrifice of ſweet ſavour, which would advance that bloody Tyrant to a very eminent Station in the Regions of Immortality.

ſo horrible and bloody, no Attempt ſo miſchievous and treacherous, no Enterprize ſo baſe and cruel, but what you may find committed by them under the ſacred Name of Religion and Conſcience. For Witneſs, laſtly, the black, unparallell'd Undertaking of this Day, when againſt all the Laws of God and Man, of Juſtice and Gratitude, of Humanity and Reaſon, one of the Beſt of Kings and moſt Indulgent of Princes, was with the Queen and Prince at one Thunder Clap to have been ſent to Heaven.</p>
            <p>One might reaſonable expect to hear of ſome unuſual Provocation, that rais'd theſe Mens Spirits to ſuch an incredible height of Immanity. But, alas! the moſt enraged of them never ſeriouſly alledg'd any; and if they had, the very Stones in the Wall would have found a Voice to have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd them. For if Mercy and Goodneſs if Kindneſs and Benevolence, if Paternal Care and Royal Indulgence, have any Charms or Endearments, they all concen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred in that Excellent Prince they thought to have deſtroy'd. Paſt Experience had richly demonſtrated, how impatiently theſe Blood-hounds thirſted after Royal Blood; yet ſo gloriouſly did his Mercy tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph over his other Virtues, that he not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wink'd at their Miſdeeds, but gave them
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:52696:123"/>
likewiſe free Acceſs to his Perſon, honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſome of them with particular Dignities, and (as he declares <note n="*" place="margin">Pag. 253.</note> himſelf) ſo animated and encouraged them by his as much un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected as undeſerved Favours, that they did directly expect, and aſſuredly promiſe themſelves Liberty of Conſcience, and Equality with his other Subjects in all things. And yet (as tho' we muſt firſt ceaſe to be Men, before we can commence <hi>Papiſts</hi>; and renounce both our Reaſon and Conſcience, to become ſervants to his Holineſs) tho' under the benign Influence of his ſo happy Reign they bask'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the pleaſant Rivers of overflowing Felicity; tho' (I ſay) they ſat under his Shadow with great Delight, whilſt his Banner over them was Love, the poyſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Seeds of that peſtilential Hereſie, had (as appears from their own Confeſſions) ſo infected, or rather quite choak'd the good Seed of Nature, that (notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the Obligations that Heaven and Earth could lay upon them) Hell got the upper hand, and they thirſted after his Blood. Good God! That Men, who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs themſelves the Diſciples of a poor, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpis'd and crucifi'd Saviour, whoſe Life, tho' he had all the heavenly Hoſt at his Command, was one continued Lecture of

Humility, Meekneſs, and Self-denial, and whoſe whole Doctrine reſolvable into this one Precept, <hi>Love one another,</hi> ſhould be ſo far from following his Example in ſaving Mens Lives, and doing all the Good they can, that they go about with his Profeſs'd Adverſary, ſeeking whom they may devour. That the Profeſſors of that Religion, which is made up of Purity, Piety, Peace and Holineſs, ſhould delight in cruel Treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, bloody Maſſacres, and tragical Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, nay think by ſo doing <gap reason="foreign">

Does it not ſeize you with Amazement, to think that the Servants of the Prince of Peace ſhould delight above all others to imbrue their hands in Blood, and that the Followers of the meek Lamb of God ſhould degenerate into ravenous Wolves and Tygers! That the Vicar of Chriſt, who expreſly declares that his Kingdom is not of this World, ſhould magiſteriouſly take upon him to diſpoſe of Crowns and Scepters, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolently to trample upon the Necks of Kings and Emperours? Certainly, if theſe things are indeed conſonant to the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples

of Chriſtanity, I know no Reaſon that great Statiſt <hi>Machiavel</hi> had to complain that it rendered Men unfit for cruel Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings; or why thoſe Heathen Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, which Perſecuted it moſt, ſhould not be canoniz'd for Saints, ſince they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly did the Office of good Patriots in endeavouring to rid the World of ſuch Men who made it their buſineſs to turn it upſide down.

They did not indeed with his other ſubjects exalt him above the Level of deſpis'd Mortality, and therefore they nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther gave him Sacrifice, nor ſwore by his Genius but (what really became good and pious Men) they fought his Battels, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour'd his Perſon, rever'd his Power, paid his Tribute, offer'd up Prayers for him, and obey'd his Laws, unleſs where they evidently contradicted the Laws of Chriſt
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:52696:124"/>
and where they did, ſubmitted to the moſt cruel Penalties they laid upon them, with the greateſt Calmneſs and Serenity of Soul. And when, notwithſtanding all this, they were accus'd (as indeed they often were) as Enemies to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> they thought it highly concern'd them for the Honour of their Religion, by all means poſſible to wipe off theſe Stains, which were falſly laid upon them; and according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we find them in their Apologies and other Writings with all the Zeal imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able vindicating themſelves from ſuch mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Aſperſions. <gap reason="foreign">

Primitive Chriſtians never thought it their Duty to aſſaſſinate Princes, tho' Pagan or Heretical, for the Cauſe of Religion, or to excite their Subjects to Rebellion for the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of the Goſpel. They did not illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Mens Underſtandings with Fire and Faggots, nor convince or ſilence Gainſayers by the uncontroulable Arguments of Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolical Dragooners. As their Battels were Spiritual, ſo neither were their Weapons Carnal. 'Twas the peculiar Honour of their Profeſſion, that it grew victorious by Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and triumph'd in Perſecutions: That Tears were its Jewels, and its Chains its chiefeſt Ornaments: That whereas all other Religions, in the World did by a multitude of Sacrifices as it were, train up and inure Mens Minds to Blood and Deſtruction it was always (like its great Author) upon the Paſſive; not by Swords and Daggers, by Fire and Faggots, by Plots and Caballs, but by enduring all things, by bearing all things, recommending it ſelf to the World.

            <p n="2">2. We cannot better expreſs our Joy and Gratitude to God for the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendant Mercy of this Day, than by letting it remind us of his infinite Goodneſs in calling us from the Tents of theſe wicked Men, who by teaching and maintaining ſuch pernicious Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, do not only (as you have already ſeen) carry Men on to the moſt heinous Immoralities, but alſo as a natural Conſequence from ſuch Premiſes, whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and entirely pervert the Simplicity of the Goſpel of Chriſt. To ſome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinking Perſons perhaps this may ſeem a bold Charge; yet I need not be long in the Proof of it. For not to tell you,
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:52696:126"/>
that theſe Men have ſet up ſuch a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Interceſſors, that as the Prophet <hi>Jeremy,</hi> ſpeaks, according to the number of their Cities, ſo are their Gods; tho' the <note n="*" place="margin">1 Tim. 2.5.</note> Apoſtle (for his Argument is levell'd againſt the Heathens, who never ſo much as heard of a Mediator of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, and therefore did only ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge thoſe of Interceſſion) ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly declares, that there is but One. Not (I ſay) to remind you, that tho' our Saviour in his Farewell-ſpeech moſt paſſionately bequeaths to us mutual Love and Kindneſs, and the more to endear this Duty to us, adds withal, that this ſhould be ſo evident a Mark of our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, that hereby ſhould all Men know, that we are indeed his Diſciples; yet <note n="†" place="margin">Vid.

What mean their Indulgences, their Fairs and Sales of Maſſes, and frequent Prayers for the dead? by all which they have inverted the Aſſertion of our bleſſed Saviour, rendring it almoſt impoſſible for a Poor Man to be Sav'd or for a Rich Man to be Damn'd? Why have they interdicted the Uſe of the Scriptures to the People, when the <note n="†" place="margin">2 Tim. 3.15.</note> Apoſtle aſſures us, that they are ſo far from doing them harm, as they pretend, that they are able to make them wiſe to Salvation? and the <note n="‖" place="margin">Pſal. 1.1, 2.</note>

Nay when <note n="*" place="margin">Joh. 5.39. <hi>and</hi> Mat. 22.29.</note> Chriſt himſelf expreſly Commands them to read them diligently, and attributes the pernicious Errors of the <hi>Sadducees</hi> to their Ignorance of them?

Alas! If you look narrowly into them, you will diſcern their Nature to be aliene and extraneous, ſome of them being borrowed purely from the Heathens, others from the Poſt of the Primitive Church, the <hi>Gnoſticks,</hi> and moſt of them (as they themſelves ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge) from Oral Tradition, there being not one Word to countenance them in all the Scriptures. But is not this to invert the Religion of Chriſt, and entirely to overthrow the fundamental and ſubſtantial Principles of our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion? Is not this, with the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> to make the Word of God of none effect by humane Traditions, or rather to preach another Goſpel than what we have receiv'd from Chriſt and his Apoſtles the which tho' an Angel from Heaven ſhould do, the <note n="†" place="margin">Gal. 1.8, 9.</note> Holy Ghoſt has long

ſince pronounc'd him accurs'd? How they are like to eſcape this Imputation at God's Tribunal, they would do well to conſider; I wiſh it could never be laid to their charge. To return then to our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: What infinite Reaſon have we to bleſs God, who has graciouſly purg'd out this old Leaven from amongſt us, and made us a new Lump unto himſelf? Who, by the glorious Inſtruments of our Reformation, has brought us out of the darkneſs of Errour and Innovation into the true and genuine Light of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel; and for thoſe Leeks and Garlick our Souls ſo much abhorr'd, feeds us with heavenly Manna to the full? Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, if Heaps of Mercies both Spiritual and Temporal; If the free Poſſeſſion of your Eſtates, and the Happineſs of being Members of the moſt uncorrupted Church in the World, are things that can in reaſon pretend to our Gratitude, we, of all Men in the World, are the moſt indebted. O then, let us never, with the ungrateful <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> hanker again after theſe loathſome Fleſh-pots; nor when we have eaten and drank to the full, riſe up to play with this Harlot any more. She will often, no doubt, be tempting and enſnaring you, and by
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:52696:128"/>
her Paints and Colours, gaudy Shows, and Pompous Pageantry, endeavour to entice you again into her Embraces. But remember, 'tis only a treacherous <hi>Syren</hi>'s Voice, which only therefore courts you, that ſhe may make you her Prey. She ſeeks not you but yours, and how Zealous ſoever ſhe may ſeem for your Welfare, the Term of her deſire is only her own. She knows the Fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of your Land, the Liberality of your Soil, and the Pleaſantneſs of your Dwellings. She remembers, how ſhe once rang'd without Controul over all your pleaſant Paſtures, and choſe out the fatteſt of your Lands, for her to ſport and play in; and therefore, ſince for the foul Apoſtaſie ſhe made from her Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Innocence, the flaming Sword and the Guardian Spirits debar her from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entring this Paradiſe, 'tis no Wonder if, the better to deceive us, ſhe transform her ſelf for a time into an Angel of Light. But I truſt the wakeful eye of Providence will ſtill diſcover her Treacheries, and not ſuffer us any more to be enſnar'd by her Smiles. And then for her Frowns, we are ſure they cannot hurt us. Thoſe Curſes ſhe ſo liberally throws againſt us,
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:52696:128"/>
will (I doubt not) take wing and fly back upon her ſelf; and all thoſe Bulls and Interdicts, Anathema's, Curſes, and Excommunications which yearly in Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion Week, the better to prepare her ſelf for the Celebration of the Lords Supper, ſhe charitably denounceth againſt us, either prove <hi>Bruta fulmina,</hi> Thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claps, which indeed make a Noiſe, but want a killing Bolt, or by woful Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounds turn the direful Execution upon her own Head. In a word, If we take care to walk worthy of the Vocation wherewith we are call'd, and not diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour Reform'd Religion by the Deformity of our Lives, maugre all the Malice of Earth and Hell, of Men and Devils, we ſhall undoubtedly be ſav'd. Damnation will not be inflicted according to mens Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and Uncharitableneſs, neither will the grim Faces, and dreadful Menaces of <hi>Romiſh</hi> Emiſſaries exclude us from the Favour and Bleſſing of Heaven. Tho' they reject us, Chriſt will embrace us; Tho' they turn us out of their Synagogues, God, will receive us under his Wings; and provided we forfeit not his Protection by our Miſdemeanours, the Angel of his Preſence will undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:52696:129"/>
continue to ſave us, till Time it ſelf ſhall be no more. Wherefore, that we may not peculiarly incur this Judgment by our Ingratitude, but duly expreſs our Joy and Thankfulneſs to God for the tranſcendent Mercy of this Day, let us</p>
            <p n="3">3. Take Care both to continue our ſelves, and alſo to bequeath to our Poſterity a grateful Remembrance of it. How near was the Daughter of <hi>Zion</hi> to be covered with a Cloud, and to be trampled under foot by her treacherous Enemies? The Net (you have heard) was caſt about her, and the Fowlers even haſting to the Slaughter. The Train was laid, all the Inſtruments of death prepar'd, and there remain'd nothing to make us an Holocauſt to the <hi>Roman Moloch,</hi> but juſt putting the lighted Match to the Powder. And yet, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks, I hear the Church, full of Faith, ſaying, Tho' no Danger was ever like to any Danger, yet I charge You, O ye Daughters of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> by the Roes and by the Hinds of the Field, that ye ſtir not up, nor awake my Love, 'till he pleaſe. For how forlorn and deſtitute ſoever I may ſeem to ſome, yet I am my Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved's,
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:52696:129"/>
and my Beloved is mine, tho' therefore he tarries, he will not be long, but will in due time look forth as the Morning, fair as the Moon, clear as the Sun, and terrible as an Army with Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. And indeed her Beloved came, when ſhe expected him not; He was found of her, when ſhe ſought not after him. He awaked as one out of Sleep, and look'd and ſaw there was none to help, and wondred that there was none to uphold. Therefore his own Arm brought Salvation to her, and his infinite Goodneſs alone upheld her. May then that God, who has thus wonderfully wrought for us in ſnatching us from the Mouth of the Lion, and the Paw of the Bear, be ever bleſſed; and the Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of this unſpeakable Mercy never defac'd, ſo long as the Sun and Moon ſhall endure. May thoſe glorious Spirits, which before pity'd our Danger, and now rejoyce at our Deliverance, never be fruſtrated in their Expectations; but ſee all our Members and Faculties, our Lips and Lives, Hearts and Voices, harmoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly ſinging the Triumphs of the Lord, and in the continual Order, Concord, and Congruity, declaring the infinite
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:52696:130"/>
Goodneſs of our God; that ſo our Candleſtick may never be remov'd for our Ingratitude, but, tho' Darkneſs cover the Earth, and groſs Darkneſs the People, This Church may ſtill be a Crown of Glory in the Hand of the Lord and a Royal Diadem in the Hand of her God, that the <hi>Gentiles</hi> may admire her Beauty, and the Sons alſo of them that afflicted her, come bending unto her: and all they that deſpis'd her bow themſelves down at the Soles of her Feet: and all the Nations round about call her the City of the Lord, the <hi>Zion</hi> of the Holy one of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> Laſtly, May ſhe be covered with the Robes of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, and continually cloath'd with the Garments of Salvation, 'till the Great Year of Jubilee, the time of her final Redemption ſhall come, when God ſhall put an End to all Prejudices and Animoſities, all Struglings and contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and all the Elect with Crowns on their Heads, and Palms in their hands ſhall make one perfect Harmony in ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the eternal Praiſe of God and of the Lamb.</p>
